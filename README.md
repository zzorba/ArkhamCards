# Arkham Cards

Create and edit decks for all of your investigators -- it will even check the deck-building rules to keep you honest. You can also group together decks into campaigns to track your progress combatting evils. The app can be used with local decks, or you can link your ArkhamDB account to sync changes on the go.

* Edit and upgrade your investigator's decks, either offline or by linking your ArkhamDB account.
* Track scenario results and keep the campaign log up to date.
* Keep track of investigator trauma and assign new random basic weaknesses as you take on new madness.
* Log the chaos bag as it changes, letting you have multiple campaigns going at once as you wait for the next month's mythos pack.
* Use the advanced card search to search by trait, health, shroud, etc. A great tool if you ever need to evaluate how many 'non-elite' enemies can be targeted by a card or know which locations a Flashlight wielding Zoey can actually stand a chance at investigating.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps on [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to install React Native dependencies for your environment. Once you have those you can clone the repo and get started.

Install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and run the following command to use the appropriate Node version:

`nvm use`

Install NPM dependencies

`npm install` or `yarn install`

For iOS Install CocoaPods

```
cd ios
pod install
```

Start the bundle server in the background

`npm start` or `yarn start`

Build App

`npm ios` or `npm android` (or their `yarn` counterparts)

## Translations
The app is currently translated into English, Spanish, German, Italian, French, Russian and Chinese, and partially translated into Korean, Portuguese and Polish. Translation data for all of the cards comes from ArkhamDB.com, and is community managed. You can submit edits for cards in the [arkhamdb-json-data](https://github.com/kamalisk/arkhamdb-json-data/) project with a pull request.

For all the text of the app itself, the translation files are extracted using the unix program `gettext`, an i18n standard. There are many programs that are capable of editing them, but I've found that a program called [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/), which has a free version that is totally serviceable. Using this program, you can edit the .po files in the [assets/i18n](https://github.com/zzorba/ArkhamCards/tree/master/assets/i18n) folder and submit the changes via Pull Request (or by opening an issue and I will provide contact information on how to submit changes). Be sure that you do not directly edit the .po.json files, they are a build product.

Lastly, the campaign guide feature translations live here [https://github.com/zzorba/arkham-cards-data/tree/master/i18n](https://github.com/zzorba/arkham-cards-data/tree/master/i18n). The translated parts of each guide are kept there in individual PO files. If you are updating them, it is a good idea to copy-paste blocks of text from the FFG PDF files, which require only light reformatting. Some instructions need to be adjusted to fit the app.
