          "answer": "When you draw Quantum Collapse, check if you have any face-down encounter cards in your threat area. If you do, draw all of them, one at a time. If you don't, put Quantum Collapse face-down in your threat area. Additionally, if you drew it from the threat area, take 1 horror too. If you drew Quantum Collapse from your threat area and it was the only face-down card you have, immediately put it back because of its revelation effect."

          "question": "How does the <b>Agenda deck</b> work?",
          "answer": "The agenda deck is a randomized set of 3 agendas. Whenever you advance it, read and resolve the top ability. Then, set it aside. If that was the last agenda, add 1 Impending Doom and shuffle all the set aside agendas together again to create the new agenda deck that you will use from now on. So, in practice, after you \"finish\" the agenda deck, you \"reset\" it and start over with an agenda deck composed of the same 3 agendas, randomly shuffled."
