          "answer": "In general cases, all that matters is that you were able to attack the Hound when you <b>initiate</b> your action / effect / ability. So in the example of attacking with a <b>Fight</b> event, that is possible, as long as you have an odd number of cards when you are about to play the <b>Fight</b> event. Note that it will still Retaliate even if you have an even number of cards now, since it is a response to your attack."

If you don't, put Quantum Collapse face-down in your threat area. Additionally, if you drew it from the threat area, take 1 horror too.

If that was the last agenda, add 1 Impending Doom and shuffle all the set aside agendas together again to create the new agenda deck that you will use from now on. So, in practice, after you \"finish\" the agenda deck, you \"reset\" it and start over with an agenda deck composed of the same 3 agendas, randomly shuffled."
