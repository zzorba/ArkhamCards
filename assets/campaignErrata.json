Additionally, the cards in the pile of potential sacrifices and underneath the agenda deck cannot be affected by player card effects or investigator actions.\nThus, if a unique asset is Kidnapped!, an investigator cannot play another copy of that asset. Additionally, if a player resigns or is defeated, any cards he or she owns that are in the pile of potential sacrifices or facedown underneath the agenda deck will remain as such."
