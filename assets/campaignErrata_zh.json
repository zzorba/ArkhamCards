(Since the cards are facedown, you should try to remember which unique allies were kidnapped and added to the pile of potential sacrifices without having to look at it.) Additionally, the cards in the pile of potential sacrifices and underneath the agenda deck cannot be affected by player card effects or investigator actions.\nThus, if a unique asset is Kidnapped!, an investigator cannot play another copy of that asset. Additionally, if a player resigns or is defeated, any cards he or she owns that are in the pile of potential sacrifices or facedown underneath the agenda deck will remain as such."
