This includes all story assets and weaknesses earned in the original campaign, as well as experience gained and trauma suffered. Everything recorded in the campaign log under that investigator’s \"Earned Story Assets / Weaknesses\" should be transferred to the new campaign, as well.\n- All other notes in the Campaign Log should be wiped clean and do not transfer to the new campaign.\n- The chaos bag is reset.

Goat Spawn has the following <b>Forced</b> ability: “When Goat Spawn is defeated: Each investigator at this location takes 1 horror.” Before resolving the damage dealt to the Guard Dog, 1 horror is dealt to each investigator at the location, including Agnes, who has a [reaction] ability: “After 1 or more horror is placed on Agnes Baker: Deal 1 damage to an enemy at your location.” Before resolving the Goat Spawn’s defeat, Agnes deals 1 damage to the Ghoul Minion engaged with her. Now that there are no further [reaction] or <b>Forced</b> abilities to trigger, the players return to the previous triggering condition and resolve the Goat Spawn’s defeat, and resolve any “After...” effects that might occur when it is defeated. Then, the players resolve the damage dealt to the Guard Dog, and resolve any “After...” effects that might occur from that damage.

Instructions for resolving the designated resolution are found in the \"do not read until end of game\" section of the campaign manual.\nThe agenda deck represents the objectives and progress of the malicious forces pitted against the investigators in the scenario. Some instructions in the agenda deck (as well as on other encounter cardtypes) also contain resolution points, in the format of: \"<b>(→R#)</b>.\" Should the agenda deck invoke a (usually darker) resolution, the players have lost the scenario. Instructions for resolving the designated resolution are found in the \"do not read until end of game\" section of the campaign guide.\nShould the scenario end with no resolution being reached *(for example, if all investigators have been eliminated or have resigned)*, instructions for resolving the scenario can be found in the \"do not read until end of game\" section of the campaign guide.\n- If playing in a campaign, players will proceed to the next scenario in the campaign regardless of the outcome of the scenario. Even if players \"lose\" a scenario, they still continue their campaign (although with some negative consequences from their failure).\n- When playing a standalone scenario, players either win or lose the scenario. They win if they complete a resolution on an act card. Any other resolution is considered a loss (see \"[Standalone Mode](#Standalone_Mode)\").\nSee \"[Act Deck and Agenda Deck](#Act_Deck_and_Agenda_Deck)\"."

Young Deep One reads: \"After Young Deep One engages you...\" This clause identifies \"you\" as any investigator who engages Young Deep One.</i>\n- Any other instance of \"you/your\" that does not fall into the above categories refers to the investigator who controls the card, the investigator who has the card in his/her threat area, or who is currently interacting with the card.\nA card may have multiple different abilities in which \"you/your\" may be interpreted differently. “You/your” may refer to a different investigator in each of these abilities.\n<i>For example: Dreams of R’lyeh reads:</i>\n<i>\"<b>Revelation</b> - Put Dreams of R’lyeh into play in your threat area.\nYou get –1 [willpower] and –1 sanity.\n[action]: Test [willpower] (3). If you succeed, Discard Dreams of R’lyeh.\"</i>\nThese three abilities reference \"you/your\" in different ways. For the <b>Revelation</b> ability, \"your\" refers to the investigator who drew Dreams of R’lyeh and is resolving its <b>Revelation</b>. For its constant ability, \"you\" refers to the investigator who has Dreams of R’lyeh in his or her threat area. For its [action] ability, \"you\" refers to the investigator who is performing the [action] ability."

(This includes verifying that the resolution of the effect has the potential to change the game state.) If the play restrictions are not met, abort this process.\n- Determine the cost (or costs, if multiple costs are required) to play the card or initiate the ability. If it is established that the cost (taking modifiers into account) can be paid, proceed with the remaining steps of this sequence.\nOnce each of the above confirmations has been made, follow these steps, in order:\n1. Apply any modifiers to the cost(s).\n2. Pay the cost(s). If this step is reached and the cost(s) cannot be paid, abort this process without paying any costs.\n- Upon completion of this step, attacks of opportunity, if applicable, resolve.\n3. The card commences being played, or the effects of the ability attempt to initiate.\n4. The effects of the ability (if not canceled in step 3) complete their initiation, and resolve.
