Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn’t steal tucked beneath several other documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage’s desk.\nThe journal appears to be written in a strange language you cannot decode, using a script you’ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it seems Dr. Armitage had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it belongs to one “Wilbur Whateley.” The journal—along with Armitage’s many notes—tells a startling tale, one you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier tonight…"

Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round it was bad news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs and looks away.\n“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes in, putting a wrinkled hand on your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely remember anything else from that night.\nWhen you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst, you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find answers."

His face is pale, his forehead sweaty and wrinkled with worry.\nArmitage—the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours—privately contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You’d always known Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\nThe elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. “I am looking for two of my colleagues—Dr. Francis Morgan, professor of archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A very… <b>familiar</b> feeling.” You’ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. “I tried to find Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n“I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.”"

Joe took a few trinkets for himself, of course, but Curtis wanted nothing to do with it. Folk already didn’t trust him on account of his family’s sins, even though he’d been attending church on the regular and had stayed far away from anything resembling the arcane.\nEven so, Curtis could not shake a sense of foreboding. He’d seen the devastation that befell the Ericks, Bishop, and Frye homes. He’d even seen firsthand the creature the folks from Arkham had banished. Some days, his thoughts led him to Wilbur Whateley’s farm, where he would stand outside and stare for hours, too scared to enter, but too curious to leave. Maybe there was something in there that could make these terrible visions depart. Something that could give him strength enough to resist the nightmares. Curtis decided he would find it."

She shook her head. Outsiders rarely traveled to Dunwich, and all the signposts leading to the village had been taken down. But these days, even the townsfolk who had called this place home had abandoned it.\n“I don’t know,” Gené admitted. “But somebody is here, and this isn’t the first sign we’ve seen like this. Stories say there’s an altar where the townsfolk would conduct pagan rituals atop that hill. Maybe we’ll find more up there.”"

It cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and the people and creatures who attacked here in Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re certain now where you must head: the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\nYou consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax. Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy, and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further.\nYou pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning, you head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage’s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon Whateley who was present during the events several months ago.\nArmitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and unscrupulous, others “undecayed” or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the closest station and drive you into town\nAs the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and exhaustion sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise behind you…"

You are in an unfathomable place, vast beyond your ability to reason and utterly alien besides. The landscape is surreal and strange, the architecture impossible. You are so far from home that home has become a threadbare dream you can barely recall. Even should you find a way out of this awful place, you may never be the same again."

At first you imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a different picture.\nIt all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human."

If my instincts are correct, the assailants you’ve encountered will be searching for it.

Reading through these materials leaves you exhausted and emotionally drained. Most of the content was written by a single source—a man named Seth Bishop. When you ask around town, you learn that Seth is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident. Curiously, since that time, very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed his eyes had been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale.\nYou don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would appear nervous or paranoid. But the more you read of his frantic and unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events. His writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence” into other creatures, and eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow are unfathomably complex and defy understanding.\nBefore you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and women from the village approach you in a panic. “It’s back!” one of them wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch. “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the Bishops’ home like it were made o’ paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic."

As soon as you step outside, you sense a foulness in the cold night air: an awful, pungent smell that can scarcely be described and a heaviness to the atmosphere that makes it difficult to breathe. The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below.\nFlocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you, watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck. As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature — <b>Yog‐Sothoth</b>. Failing to stop this ritual may spell doom…not only Dunwich, but for the entire world."

You raise your hands and brace for the worst. “Wait,” one of them says, raising his hand to the others. “I recognize you from the Clover Club.” He grins toothily and lowers his weapon. “Naomi sends her regards.”\nCurious, you ask what the gangsters are doing here. “Ms. O’Bannion had us investigate the attack on her fiancé’s club,” he explains. “Turns out there were some men in Arkham behind the whole thing. Some Bishop fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before he can explain further, the all-too-familiar ratta‐tat of a tommy gun echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny. Come on, boys!” He beckons to the others to follow and runs up the hill. Shaking your head, you do the same. These mobsters don’t know what they’re getting into."

A silent, unspoken anger grips the town. Tempers are short, and in the last week alone there have been numerous reports of townspeople coming to heated, violent blows with one another over simple misunderstandings.\nAnd now, a call from James Hankerson. He claims to have found a dismembered body in his barn.\nBlaming the weather would be too easy. There is something wrong with this town, and not a whole lot this old soothsayer can do to stop the slide. My auguries indicate a small group of investigators will soon take note of these strange happenings and set forth to make things right. I’ll be watching their progress… but I won’t be holding my breath."

Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot fathom what to expect.\n“Many of the cultists,” Lita continues, “will seem like everyday people, despite their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.”"

However, a surprising detail also turns up: the one who invaded the lair and set this night’s events in motion was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this important detail was omitted from Lita’s story—did she tell you only as much as was necessary to draw you into her conflict? But in another light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city of Arkham from a terrible menace.\nThe final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by one of the cultists. It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within the woods south of Arkham, this very night. According to the journal, the ritual’s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult’s dark master into this world. “If the cult is not stopped,” Lita warns, “there is a possibility that Umôrdhoth’s vengeance will consume all in its path.” Frightened but determined to stop the ritual, you head into the woods…"

It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail… And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\nYou’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

That I should… Prepare.” Nigel turns toward you as he reaches the wooden door across from you, his eyes flashing. “Don’t worry. All is ready. The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret his cryptic comments. You wait a few minutes for him to return, but when he does not, you begin to worry. Then you notice that mold has already begun to grow over the cheese he’d brought you. “Mr. Engram?” you call out, and you hesitantly knock on the door to his study. There is no response.

However, by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much higher than you’d anticipated. Dark clouds cover the sky, and a distant crash of thunder signals the start of the oncoming storm. You find a boat whose captain is willing to take you to the island, and prepare for the ritual to come."

Your mind is a flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t staked a claim on, I tell you.”\nYou stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking. “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty— save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost.",

Bursting through the door, to the stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk sergeant, who is lazily working through a stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist, but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice. “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your back as he escorts you out of the station.\nYou <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your coat pocket, hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek.",

A small part of you wonders if this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget. Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior looks the same as it did when you arrived to see The King in Yellow earlier that night. You walk to the front window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\nJust then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\nHis unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out.

The threat of the Stranger looms in your mind, and you find yourself glancing often at your rear-view mirror, expecting to see the expressionless visage of his mask haunting you. Instead, you see nothing but the misty, starless night, and the deserted road behind you.\nYour thoughts once again wander, as they have often in the past few hours, to The King in Yellow and to the city of Carcosa and its inhabitants. What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of The King in Yellow was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed by the same man: Nigel Engram.\nThere is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occuring within the city: the Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of The King in Yellow, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the questions that burn in your mind."

Dawn breaks as you reach the boarding house, the front doorknob and ferns on the porch covered in dew.

Your head twinges with pain and your vision swims with brilliant colors. Your skin is singed by the flames. Below you, the abyss opens and swallows you whole. You then find yourself in a dank, windowless cell, filled with a putrid stench. A man is huddled in a corner of the room, shivering from the cold, or from the hopelessness of his situation, or perhaps both. “No mask,” he mutters over and over, “no mask, no mask…” You take a few tentative steps forward, but before you can reach him, the metal slot on his cell door slides open, and you hear an orderly call to him. “Daniel, it’s time,” he says. “Daniel, wake up. Wake up, Daniel.” Then, you awaken.",

It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”\nHours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts, mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that he has been choked to death."

You enter cautiously, wondering if the police are onto you. Or worse, the Stranger. You are surprised to find the body of Daniel Chesterfield instead, lying on the ground with a pained, wide-eyed expression on his face. He is dead. His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n<center><fancy>[elder_sign]Carcosa is real</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>Do not let them open the path</fancy></center>\nWhen Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:\n<center><fancy>Hastur is the king in tatters</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>locked in his prison in the stars</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>seal him away and stop this madness!</fancy></center>\nYour mind swims with questions. How did he escape the asylum? How did he die? And why does he appear human to your eyes now? With little time to spare, you clean the room of your belongings and flee.

Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling upon the steering wheel."

From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off toward Southside, full of grim determination."

An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\nTo have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\nFinding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\nThe lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep."

The role of Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\nJust then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away— his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black."

You are stunned to discover that it is the unabridged script of The King in Yellow. Drawn on the cover in black ink is the very same diagram whose meaning you have been struggling to interpret for several sleepless nights. Who had placed it here? How had it come to your hotel room? Regardless, you know what you must do. The play holds the secrets—it has all along—and yet like a fool you have avoided reading Act II out of superstition. Its words cannot harm you any more than the creatures and fanatics you have already encountered. Trembling, you open to the second part, and begin to read.",

Exasperated, you place the skull on your night table and try to get some sleep for the first time since escaping the catacombs. As you fall asleep, you cannot shake the sight of the diagram etched in the skull’s forehead.\nYou awaken with a spark of inspiration and rush to the Musée du Louvre, a famous Parisian museum housing tens of thousands of paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. You spend days exploring the museum—every display, every collection, every single object of art that might hold a clue to the diagram’s meaning. Finally, you see it: a painting depicting a beautiful island town weathering a torrential storm. Waves crash against the stone of the outer wall, the tide threatening to swallow the island whole. Lightning flashes around the tower of the abbey above the village. A whirlwind of black clouds churns in the sky above. The diagram from the burned skull you hold in your hands is recreated perfectly in the stained glass of the abbey. The title of the piece is “The Path Is Open.”",

Suicides. Vanishings.\nIt would seem that Daniel is your only lead, if you are to investigate further. According to the records you found, he was admitted to Arkham Asylum many years ago. All documentation about Daniel’s treatment seems to end there. You’re unsure if he’s even still alive. Perhaps he was cured and released.

Inside is a wealth of information about the patients admitted to the asylum—medical records, psychiatric evaluations, and the like. You recognize a few of the faces as he flips through the pages. “Daniel… Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of Doctor Mintz. But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.” You argue and insist to be let into the patient wing, knowing that Daniel must hold the key to understanding what is really going on.\nThe receptionist gives a pitying smile and relents, nodding to the security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of course,” he says with all the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you with Doctor Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel.

Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn’t steal tucked beneath several other documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage’s desk.\nThe journal appears to be written in a strange language you cannot decode, using a script you’ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it seems Dr. Armitage had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it belongs to one “Wilbur Whateley.” The journal—along with Armitage’s many notes—tells a startling tale, one you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier tonight…"

His face is pale, his forehead sweaty and wrinkled with worry.\nArmitage—the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours—privately contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You’d always known Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\nThe elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. “I am looking for two of my colleagues—Dr. Francis Morgan, professor of archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A very… <b>familiar</b> feeling.” You’ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. “I tried to find Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n“I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.”"

Since they’d hushed up the incident and the authorities kept their distance from these parts, Mr. Osborn had auctioned off the Ericks and Bishop families’ belongings. Joe took a few trinkets for himself, of course, but Curtis wanted nothing to do with it. Folk already didn’t trust him on account of his family’s sins, even though he’d been attending church on the regular and had stayed far away from anything resembling the arcane.\nEven so, Curtis could not shake a sense of foreboding. He’d seen the devastation that befell the Ericks, Bishop, and Frye homes. He’d even seen firsthand the creature the folks from Arkham had banished. Some days, his thoughts led him to Wilbur Whateley’s farm, where he would stand outside and stare for hours, too scared to enter, but too curious to leave. Maybe there was something in there that could make these terrible visions depart. Something that could give him strength enough to resist the nightmares. Curtis decided he would find it."

Coupled with the report from the university…she wasn’t sure what to think. “Ms. Beauregard,” her assistant called out to her, “have you found something?”\nGené stood and turned to face the freshman who’d been assigned to her. He was a good kid and a bit callow, but a hard worker and eager to prove himself. “This place was supposed to be cordoned off,” Gené responded. “Nobody’s lived here for months. And yet, see for yourself: their primitive rites continue to this day.”\nThe student approached and joined Gené in examining the sign, flipping through the pages of his journal to reference its symbols. “What do you think it means?” he asked. She shook her head. Outsiders rarely traveled to Dunwich, and all the signposts leading to the village had been taken down. But these days, even the townsfolk who had called this place home had abandoned it.\n“I don’t know,” Gené admitted. “But somebody is here, and this isn’t the first sign we’ve seen like this. Stories say there’s an altar where the townsfolk would conduct pagan rituals atop that hill. Maybe we’ll find more up there.”"

Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round it was bad news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs and looks away.\n“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes in, putting a wrinkled hand on your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely remember anything else from that night.\nWhen you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst, you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find answers."

      "text": "Recent events in the Museum have forced you to re-evaluate Armitage’s tale about Dunwich. It cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and the people and creatures who attacked here in Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re certain now where you must head: the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\nYou consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax. Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy, and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further.\nYou pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning, you head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage’s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon Whateley who was present during the events several months ago.\nArmitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and unscrupulous, others “undecayed” or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the closest station and drive you into town\nAs the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and exhaustion sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise behind you…"

At first you imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a different picture.\nIt all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human."

When you ask around town, you learn that Seth is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident. Curiously, since that time, very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed his eyes had been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale.\nYou don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would appear nervous or paranoid. But the more you read of his frantic and unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events. His writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence” into other creatures, and eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow are unfathomably complex and defy understanding.\nBefore you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and women from the village approach you in a panic. “It’s back!” one of them wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch. “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the Bishops’ home like it were made o’ paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic."

The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below.\nFlocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you, watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck. As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature — <b>Yog‐Sothoth</b>. Failing to stop this ritual may spell doom…not only Dunwich, but for the entire world."

Some Bishop fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before he can explain further, the all-too-familiar ratta‐tat of a tommy gun echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny. Come on, boys!” He beckons to the others to follow and runs up the hill. Shaking your head, you do the same. These mobsters don’t know what they’re getting into."

A silent, unspoken anger grips the town. Tempers are short, and in the last week alone there have been numerous reports of townspeople coming to heated, violent blows with one another over simple misunderstandings.\nAnd now, a call from James Hankerson. He claims to have found a dismembered body in his barn.\nBlaming the weather would be too easy. There is something wrong with this town, and not a whole lot this old soothsayer can do to stop the slide. My auguries indicate a small group of investigators will soon take note of these strange happenings and set forth to make things right. I’ll be watching their progress… but I won’t be holding my breath."

Your findings are disturbing: they claim to worship a being known as Umôrdhoth, a monstrous entity from another realm.\nYou are able to confirm much of Lita’s story: the cult is agitated over the destruction of a ghoul lair. However, a surprising detail also turns up: the one who invaded the lair and set this night’s events in motion was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this important detail was omitted from Lita’s story—did she tell you only as much as was necessary to draw you into her conflict? But in another light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city of Arkham from a terrible menace.\nThe final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by one of the cultists. It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within the woods south of Arkham, this very night. According to the journal, the ritual’s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult’s dark master into this world. “If the cult is not stopped,” Lita warns, “there is a possibility that Umôrdhoth’s vengeance will consume all in its path.” Frightened but determined to stop the ritual, you head into the woods…"

Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot fathom what to expect.\n“Many of the cultists,” Lita continues, “will seem like everyday people, despite their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.”"

It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”\nHours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts, mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that he has been choked to death."

You enter cautiously, wondering if the police are onto you. Or worse, the Stranger. You are surprised to find the body of Daniel Chesterfield instead, lying on the ground with a pained, wide-eyed expression on his face. He is dead. His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n<center><fancy>[elder_sign]Carcosa is real</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>Do not let them open the path</fancy></center>\nWhen Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:\n<center><fancy>Hastur is the king in tatters</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>locked in his prison in the stars</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>seal him away and stop this madness!</fancy></center>\nYour mind swims with questions. How did he escape the asylum? How did he die? And why does he appear human to your eyes now? With little time to spare, you clean the room of your belongings and flee.

As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling upon the steering wheel."

An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\nTo have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\nFinding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\nThe lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep."

The role of Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\nJust then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away— his gaze is inescapable.

It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail… And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\nYou’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

You push these gloomy thoughts to the back of your mind and knock on Mr. Engram’s door. A flock of magpies scatters from the rooftop at the sudden noise. Then, to your surprise, the door opens.\nAcross the threshold of the doorway stands a tall man with a thick, brown mustache. A familiar silver-handled cane leans against the wall next to his coat hanger. “So it’s you,” he says. “Come in. I have expected you for some time now.” He turns away and walks toward his kitchen. You can hear a teapot whistling, as though he’d been preparing for your arrival.\nYou enter his home, unsure of what to do next. This gentle, unassuming man is not quite what you had expected. Nigel’s home is a mess of notes, old books, and strange diagrams. Covering the coffee table in his living room is an old, faded map, bearing many fold creases and tattered edges. It looks to be an incomplete map of the catacombs beneath Paris, or at least a section of it. Mr. Engram returns moments later with hot tea and a plate of cheese and crackers. “I assume you are here to find the path to Carcosa?” he asks, wearing an excited grin. You shake your head in response, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He paces back and forth around the room as he speaks rapidly. “He told me that you would be arriving soon. That I should… Prepare.” Nigel turns toward you as he reaches the wooden door across from you, his eyes flashing. “Don’t worry. All is ready. The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret his cryptic comments. You wait a few minutes for him to return, but when he does not, you begin to worry. Then you notice that mold has already begun to grow over the cheese he’d brought you. “Mr. Engram?” you call out, and you hesitantly knock on the door to his study. There is no response. When you enter the room, you find him hanging from the ceiling fan, his body rotting from weeks of decomposition.",

Only this tale is one of horrors and madness. During low tide, you would be able to reach the island on foot by crossing the tidal causeway that emerges from the sea. However, by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much higher than you’d anticipated. Dark clouds cover the sky, and a distant crash of thunder signals the start of the oncoming storm. You find a boat whose captain is willing to take you to the island, and prepare for the ritual to come."

      "text": "Once again you are startled awake, this time by the cold, clammy fingers of a hand on your shoulder. “Are you alright?” an elderly man asks, helping you to your feet. Your mind is a flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t staked a claim on, I tell you.”\nYou stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking. “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty— save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost.",

Bursting through the door, to the stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk sergeant, who is lazily working through a stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist, but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice. “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your back as he escorts you out of the station.\nYou <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your coat pocket, hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek.",

A small part of you wonders if this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget. Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior looks the same as it did when you arrived to see The King in Yellow earlier that night. You walk to the front window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\nJust then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\nHis unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out.

Was it all just a terrible dream?\nYou exit the auditorium before the crowd rushes to do the same. Dizziness and exhaustion harries your senses. The weight of your lengthy investigation is crushing your mind. By the time you finally reach the lobby, you are clawing your way across the ground. Just then, a man in an elegant suit reaches down and grabs you by your arm, pulling you to your feet. You are about to thank him when you realize who he is. The sight of him causes you to stagger backward in horror momentarily. The actor who plays the role of the Stranger is still wearing his pale, featureless mask. He gives you a wordless bow, then turns and leaves through the Ward Theatre’s front entrance.",

Instead, you see nothing but the misty, starless night, and the deserted road behind you.\nYour thoughts once again wander, as they have often in the past few hours, to The King in Yellow and to the city of Carcosa and its inhabitants. What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of The King in Yellow was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed by the same man: Nigel Engram.\nThere is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occuring within the city: the Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of The King in Yellow, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the questions that burn in your mind."

You then find yourself in a dank, windowless cell, filled with a putrid stench. A man is huddled in a corner of the room, shivering from the cold, or from the hopelessness of his situation, or perhaps both. “No mask,” he mutters over and over, “no mask, no mask…” You take a few tentative steps forward, but before you can reach him, the metal slot on his cell door slides open, and you hear an orderly call to him. “Daniel, it’s time,” he says. “Daniel, wake up.

Exasperated, you place the skull on your night table and try to get some sleep for the first time since escaping the catacombs.

You spend days exploring the museum—every display, every collection, every single object of art that might hold a clue to the diagram’s meaning. Finally, you see it: a painting depicting a beautiful island town weathering a torrential storm. Waves crash against the stone of the outer wall, the tide threatening to swallow the island whole. Lightning flashes around the tower of the abbey above the village. A whirlwind of black clouds churns in the sky above. The diagram from the burned skull you hold in your hands is recreated perfectly in the stained glass of the abbey. The title of the piece is “The Path Is Open.”",

You recognize a few of the faces as he flips through the pages. “Daniel… Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of Doctor Mintz. But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.” You argue and insist to be let into the patient wing, knowing that Daniel must hold the key to understanding what is really going on.\nThe receptionist gives a pitying smile and relents, nodding to the security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of course,” he says with all the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you with Doctor Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel.

A formality. Both knew the patient was beyond repair.\n“None. The patient’s delusions remain. Demanding to speak with the Warden, claiming they are only guests, and rambling about that play that aired the other night, <u>The King in Yellow</u>.”\n“And their other crimes? The incident in the theatre? What about 1452 Atlantic Ave?”\n“They believe they were attacked, and were defending themselves.” Her voice was thick with pity. What could have caused somebody to snap like this so quickly? None of the patient’s records showed any prior history of mental instability. “Can you make any sense of it, Doctor?”\n“Who could?” Doctor Mintz sighed and stood, grabbing the file from his desk. “My job is not to understand. It is to cure. Perhaps my experimental procedures will prove fruitful on this one.” The nurse winced and felt goosebumps on her arm. She knew how his procedures would turn out, and she doubted it would prove anything.",

A hush descends on the room, until only the crackle of the fireplace and whispers of gossip can be heard. “Allow me to welcome you all into my home for this year’s charity gala. We have some very upstanding citizens here tonight, and I thank all of you for your hard work and generosity.” Cheers and murmurs of agreement fill the room. Many of the guests raise their glasses to Valentino, one of the most esteemed members of the Lodge this year, who sits at the Guest of Honor table, which is nearest to the fireplace.\nJosef ’s assistant, Jerome, blends into the wall behind Josef, discreetly checking his pocket watch. In another corner of the room, the head housekeeper, Penny, walks from table to table, filling empty glasses and collecting dirty salad plates. “Each of you has done great deeds in the name of the Silver Twilight Lodge and our historic city,” Josef continues. “Next year, we will continue to shoulder this burden and do what must be done for the sake of progress.” Jerome steps forward quietly, interrupting Josef ’s speech with the unassuming confidence that comes from years of trusted service. He taps Josef lightly on his shoulder and shows him the time. “I’m afraid I am already out of time. Thank you all very much for attending,” Josef concludes, bowing. Polite applause rises from the audience, and Josef walks briskly toward the parlor, followed closely by his assistant. Two servants collect coats as latecomers trickle into the manor, and Gavriella—Josef ’s head of security—watches over the entrance with hard eyes and a clenched jaw. “Has Mr. Sanford arrived?” Josef asks curtly, tapping his polished leather shoe on the floor.\nI’m afraid not,” Jerome replies, flipping through the last pages of the estate’s guest book. “But he should be here any minute, Mr. Meiger.”\n“Good. I want there to be no problems whatsoever when he arrives; am I understood?” Josef calls out to Gavriella: “Make sure he is well protected.” Gavriella nods, patting the handle of her .45 in her shoulder holster. Josef turns his attention back to his assistant. “And have Penny make sure the main course is kept good and hot while we wait for Mr. Sanford’s arrival. Not a single slice is to be served without his presence.”\n“Not even for Mr. Rivas, sir?” Jerome asks, glancing at Josef over the rim of his thick glasses. Josef pauses for a moment, considering.\n“Pour Mr. Rivas another glass of champagne, and I am sure he will not complain. Also, I’m still waiting on those accounts I asked you about earlier today. Don’t forget,” Josef says, clapping his assistant on the shoulder before walking back into the banquet hall. Jerome nods obediently and heads upstairs.\nSoon after, the dark mist would appear, and nothing would be the same."

By now, the remaining guests have filed into the banquet hall, and you can hear the sounds of merriment and drinking coming from beyond the wooden door behind you. You pay them no mind, remaining vigilant. Years of fighting and discipline have taught you to be ready for anything, even at a harmless banquet like this. Just as you begin to ponder whether your talents are being wasted under Mr. Meiger’s employ, a dark mist invades the parlor through the front door and the window frames, flooding the room. At first, you believe it to be only the evening fog seeping through the manor’s entryway, until you begin to notice that everything the mist touches seems to have decayed as though aged hundreds of years.\nYou step back cautiously, keeping a hand on the grip of your weapon just in case. Never in all your years have you seen something like this. An unnatural chill spreads throughout the room, and shivers run up your spine. As the ashen mist finishes pouring in, it coalesces into a singular form: a humanoid figure wrapped in shadows. It raises its hand and points at you with a charred, blackened finger.\nYou unholster your firearm and point it at the creature, allowing your training to take over. “Don’t come any closer!” you shout. The thing watching you from the entrance is unfazed. Its ethereal form begins to glide toward you, dark mist crawling over the carpet in its wake. “I warned you,” you growl, and a thunderous shot echoes through the parlor as you squeeze the trigger. The bullet rips a hole in the figure’s head like a rush of air billowing through a column of smoke. The mist stitches itself together, and the thing continues to drift your way, reaching out menacingly.\nNothing could have prepared you for combat with such an unnatural enemy. Faced with no other option, you turn and flee up the staircase nearby, pausing to squeeze off several more shots at the top. The bullets that make their target simply pass harmlessly through the ghostly figure, striking the door behind it. A few stray shots shatter a column of the staircase’s wooden balustrade."

You have served Mr. Meiger faithfully for almost a decade, and he trusts you with sensitive information like this—a point of pride for you. While you are often curious about your employer’s business, you have never pried into his personal matters. Not until tonight, anyway.\nYou adjust your glasses and lean forward as you turn to the page regarding Mr. Meiger’s request. Some of the names on the list you recognize: Rivas, Gensler, Fairmont, Rhodes, Wick. But many are names you have never heard of before, let alone seen affiliated with Mr. Meiger’s work: Lindquist, Konstantinov, Magro, Atkinson, Lamar…Just how deep do Mr. Meiger’s connections go?\nStrange as that may seem, it is the list of names on the page afterward that raises your hackles. While it was clear that the names on the previous page are associates of Mr. Meiger’s, or at least prominent members of the Lodge, you can only assume that this next series of names is of people your employer is…targeting. For what, you cannot say.\nYou stand next to Josef ’s desk and record the list in your pocket journal carefully, making sure to keep the names in the exact order they appear in Mr. Meiger’s ledger. You hope that your suspicion is nothing more than the absurd imagination of an overworked secretary. Still, something about all of this has you concerned. That, and the sudden draft of frigid air that has somehow wafted into the room. Your gaze naturally drifts to the window, at which point you scream out in shock and lose your balance, stumbling backward into Mr. Meiger’s desk.\nPressed up against the office window is a host of screaming faces emerging from the mist, or perhaps composed of it. Their ghostly hands press against the glass, their eyes hollow and empty. Your reading glasses clatter to the ground and shatter under your heel as you scramble to the other side of the office. You don’t realize that you dropped your pocket journal in the chaos until it is too late."

The dreary gambrel rooftops and Victorian manors of French Hill span the view below you, the unlit windows hiding countless secrets.\nYou can’t remember a night in which your employer was as concerned with every little detail as he is tonight. He is normally so calm, so collected. There’s something special about tonight that has him on edge. Is it Mr. Sanford? A shudder crawls through you. For some reason, something about that man gives you the creeps. But Josef has interacted with Mr. Sanford many times before, so that cannot be the reason. What could it be that has Mr. Meiger so worried?\nYou are torn from your thoughts by the gathering of grey clouds overhead, swiftly blotting out the night sky. As the clouds grow ever closer, you begin to see shapes emerging from the vapor. You squint and lean over the railing for a better view. That is when you notice the true forms of the shapes in the mist: their screaming faces, their clawing hands, all writhing in torment and coming straight for you. You cry out in terror and back up against the wall as the mist envelops the building. A spectral shape emerges from the haze beyond the railing, dressed in bloodstained rags. It begs for rest in a croaking, gasping voice. Your only hope for escape is to retreat back into the manor and call for help…"

Your opponent sets the ivory ball back on the table with a sigh.\n“I can’t help myself around ivory. You know that, Tino,” Adam replies. You rarely see Adam Gensler except during Lodge functions, but you prefer his company to that of the stuffy business types who make up most of the Lodge these days. He makes his shot, the sudden clattering interrupting the din of conversation. “Your shot, Tino. And do try to avoid hitting the nine ball first. You’re always so overeager.” Adam chuckles as he moves to the other side of the table, making way for you.\n“That was one time, my friend, one time.” You roll your eyes. Truth be told, you’ve enjoyed coming to these events for the opportunity to give back to the community, not to hobnob with Arkham’s gentry. But hobnobbing has had its perks.\nYou lean over the table and clear your mind as you line up your shot. The room falls silent as you block out the clamor and the music, focusing all of your attention on the one ball and the corner pocket. You hold your breath and strike the cue ball. It clacks as it hits its target, and the one ball drops effortlessly into the corner pocket. “There, you see?”\nIt is only then that you realize the silence around you is not just in your mind. All of the light and warmth has been sucked out of the room. Adam is gone, along with everyone else who was present just moments before you took your shot. “Hello?” you call out. A dark mist coils about your ankles as you walk around the billiards table. “If this is a practical joke of some kind, it’s in awfully poor taste,” you remark. The only response is the deep growl that emerges from beneath the table. Morbid curiosity compels you to look underneath it, at which point a dark hound pounces onto your chest, savagely clawing at your torso. You react instinctively, pushing it off of your body as hard as you can. It lands on the billiards table, causing it to collapse under the creature’s weight. You slowly back up as the creature rises to its feet once again and jumps off the broken table, its hollow eyes gazing into your soul."

It is the one ordeal every mortal must endure, and yet the one experience no mortal could possibly describe. Ghosts? Realms beyond our mortal coil? Nothing but a last resort for a mind desperate to cling to life.\nWhen the creature next invades, you have come to a new conclusion. An icy draft surrounds you as the thing coalesces before you. Your throat constricts and tears well in your eyes, but you stand tall. You are unafraid. The creature gazes at you curiously, and the piping of infernal flutes fades into silence. It extends its clawed hand, and you shake it. You will never truly be free from its grasp, but perhaps you and the creature can work in agreement. Perhaps you can tame your fear. It doesn’t matter if the world has no point. It’s yours, damnit, and nothing will stop you from altering it to your liking."

The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.\nSo far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”\n\n<right>–Minnie Klein</right>"

After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun.

If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help…only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up.

The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\nThe cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\nNO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n“Real or imagined, your fate approaches all the same.”"

The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient when Earth was born.

He examines the box closely, removing the key and the coin from the container and recognizing them instantly. “I had a feeling you would be a valuable asset to the Lodge, but it seems I underestimated your resourcefulness.

You shudder uncontrollably as your senses slowly return to you. This box is more dangerous than you could have imagined. In the hands of the Lodge, it could have been a powerful weapon, though you’re not sure what they intended to do with it. Just then, you hear several Lodge members approaching. You quickly shift one of the room’s bookcases aside and hide behind it before they enter the room. “You’re sure you heard something in here? I don’t see anybody,” one of them says.\n“Hm…” the other pauses, presumably inspecting the room for signs of intruders. “Must have been nothing.”\n“It’s all right. We’re all a bit on edge since the trap box went missing. Come, we don’t want to be late for the ceremony. Tonight is an important night.” Their footfalls become softer as they depart. The man’s words linger in your thoughts momentarily. What did he mean by tonight being an important night? This could be just as important as the puzzle box they had been attempting to open. You quietly follow the two men as they head deep into the tunnels beneath the Lodge. You struggle to keep up with them while trying to keep your footsteps silent on the stone floor of the passageway. Finally, they enter a large door with the familiar three arrows of Silver Twilight emblazoned along its surface. Ritualistic chanting fills the hall from the other side. You approach softly, placing your ear against the door to listen in.\n“Brothers and sisters,” an elderly voice announces, “thank you for coming to this hallowed gathering. The time we have long waited for approaches.” You recognize the man’s voice – it is Carl Sanford, president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and once again we must do what has to be done in order to protect it.” The crowd responds with solemn approval. “Tonight, we will complete the ritual we began many nights ago at the center of the Unvisited Isle. Tonight, we will finally bind the revenant and learn what it knows. We must not allow the secrets of AZATHOTH to be lost to those who would do humanity harm.”\nThe cult replies with a monotone hymn, and you take this opportunity to flee the Lodge before you are discovered. The conspiracy you have unveiled leaves you with even more questions. If the revenant Mr. Sanford speaks of is what you think it is, binding it will surely protect Arkham, as he claims. But what knowledge do they seek to learn from it?…and what in the hell is an “AZATHOTH?”",

You’re not sure whether it broke as a result of the beast’s emergence or as a result of its death, but either way, it is a regretful outcome. “This didn’t work as planned,” one of the robed members of the Order states matter-of-factly as you examine the crushed puzzle box.\n“That’s a hell of an understatement,” another adds. She places a hand on your shoulder and gently pulls you away from the remains of the device. “Come on, that’s a lost cause,” she says.\nHer partner ignores your presence and stoically addresses her. “We’ll have to get to the Unvisited Isle and complete the binding rite without the trap.” She nods and takes one last look at you before the remaining Lodge members flee the building.

You wish you could just return home and forget everything that has happened in the last few weeks, but you know that is just a pipe dream. After hours of aimless meandering, you snap back to reality when you realize you have wandered into Independence Square. A soft breeze carries a trail of brittle leaves across the grass of the clearing, drawing your eyes upward. There, sitting amidst a circle of autumn-colored leaves, sits Anna Kaslow. Her eyes are closed in a deep trance, her fingers pressed against the temples of her head. Laid out on the grass in front of her is a wool blanket, and on top of that, a circle of overlapping facedown tarot cards. You approach and take a seat in front of the fortune teller. It’s only now that you realize just how sore and tired you are. Every one of your muscles aches with pain, and it takes a significant amount of effort for you to not immediately pass out."

The battle may be over, but your struggle has not yet ended.” Misery catches in your throat. You want nothing more than for this nightmare to be over, but Anna’s words ring true: you know it will not end unless you put an end to it yourself.\nA flash of light burns across the sky, followed swiftly by a resounding crack of thunder. The clouds above are not natural. Phantasmal shapes shift and churn within the mist above. If you listen closely, you can faintly hear their howls of pain and sadness drifting on the wind. “It has begun,” Anna utters quietly. You rise to your feet, ignoring your exhaustion, your pain, and your fear."

Emerging from the trees, the remainder of Anette’s coven–led by the red-haired witch Erynn–surround Anette wordlessly. Erynn gives you a solemn nod, her conviction showing through her stern demeanor. Understanding why they have come, you step aside and allow them to do their work.\nOne of the witches draws a circle in the dirt around Anette, while the rest bind her with tendrils of searing energy. The revenant shrieks and wails in agony, but the witches dare not cease. Finally, as their chants rise to a crescendo, Erynn pierces the sanctity of the circle with her knife, pressing firmly against the air and straining as though she were attempting to pierce solid stone. Keziah’s ghost departs in a whirl of spectral mist, dissipating into thin air with a final cry. Anette’s body, unsupported, collapses to the ground. “It’s over,” you say, placing a hand on Erynn’s shoulder.\n“No,” she replies harshly, gesturing to the sky above. The storm clouds have all disappeared, yet you count not a single star in the night sky. The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not even realized it was there. How long had it loomed over the city while you spent your time warding against lesser incursions?\nYou ask what can be done to close a breach of such size. She clenches her jaw. “I don’t know. But I know who does.” She kneels over Anette, raises her hand, and slaps her hard across the face. Anette jerks awake, startled out of her catatonic state.\n“Is this what you wanted, sister?” Erynn drags her to her feet, forcing her to look up at the catastrophe she has wrought.\n“You know it isn’t,” Anette replies, her voice ragged. “I only wanted us all to have some semblance of the strength she possessed. I had no desire to use it in the same way she did. But the spirit took control, and I could not resist.” She lowers her head in resignation. “I’m sorry, sisters. I failed us all. I was not strong enough.”",

The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not even realized it was there. How long had it loomed over the city while you spent your time warding against lesser incursions?\nSanford limps after you, peering up at the night sky. You ask what can be done to close a breach of such size, but before he can respond, coils of darkness emerge from the shadows, twisting into dark cloaks. In seconds you are surrounded by the witches of Anette’s coven. The high priestess steps forward, glaring at Carl Sanford with all of the intensity of hell itself.\n“Do not trust the word of this sinister worm,” she warns you. “Everything he has done, he has done to further his own agenda. He would gladly hold the world hostage if it meant one last chance at power.”\nDespite his wounds, Sanford rises to his feet and bellows back at her: “What hypocrisy! Do you forget that it was you and your misguided sect who started all of this? Summoning the dead, asking them for power?” He scoffs. “We would have elevated all of humanity. You sought only to elevate yourselves.” Sanford turns to appeal to your judgment one last time. “Do not be a fool,” he says quietly. “This outcome is not what the Lodge desires. Allow me to help, and together maybe we can return things to normal.”",

The witches’ only show of resistance is the blood that drips from their eyes as their unwilling spell reaches its culmination.\n“It is time!” The disembodied voice of Keziah declares through Anette’s lips. “The Primal Chaos awaits! Hear us, Daemon Sultan!” Her voice rises into the night, and a breach greater than the sky itself opens. The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above. It reaches into infinity, beyond the confines of three-dimensional space. “I have done as you commanded of me,” she says to a being who is not present, but can hear her every word. “Now reap this world of the living, and let them suffer for their mistakes.” With that, the spectral figures vanish one by one, whisked away by the emptiness above.

He leans forward and listens intently as you explain the night’s strange events, your memories still somewhat of a haze. You conclude your story, and the elderly man considers your words. “Interesting,” he says at last. “I know of this coven. They are led by a witch named Anette Mason. Their magic is no trivial thing. They have passed down arcane secrets that can manipulate the energies of the universe. It is dangerous knowledge they possess—knowledge I believe they derived from a powerful witch who fled from Salem over two hundred years ago. Does the name ‘Keziah’ mean anything to you?”\nYou nod. Everyone in Arkham has at least some passing knowledge of the witch whose ghost supposedly haunts the old condemned “Witch House” in French Hill. Most believe her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the decrepit house. Mr. Sanford’s steely gaze and humorless tone makes it clear to you that this is not the case. “Perhaps this Anette is a true descendant of Keziah, or perhaps she is simply using her name. In any event, I believe these events are connected. To that end, I have a task for you, on behalf of the Silver Twilight Lodge.” Carl Sanford rises to his feet, using his cane more for show than for balance. You rise as well, ready to perform whatever duties are necessary to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n“We need as much information about this coven as we can obtain. If there is any place that will have these answers, it is the house where Keziah herself lived all those years ago.” You nod in agreement—there are too many questions you need answered. What spell were the witches casting that night in the woods? What is their motive? And what is their connection to the creature that kidnapped those four unfortunate souls? You shake Mr. Sanford’s hand and depart for the Witch House."

One question lingers in your mind as you consider the events that have transpired: Does Keziah’s spirit linger because of the mist, or is the mist caused by her presence? Which is the disease, and which the symptom?\nThe more you delve into Arkham’s history of witchcraft and persecution, the more restless you become. Night after night, you are assaulted by terrible dreams—dreams of death and decay, of guilt and sin. There is an evil that dwells in this city, an evil that has long remained hidden in the darkness of Arkham’s past. What’s worse, your inquiry has reached an impasse. You believe that if you can find the coven of witches you saw in the woods that fateful night, you might be able to learn more about Keziah Mason or of this unspoken evil.\nAs you go through your morning routine, your eyes drift across one of the smaller headlines of today’s newspaper: “Ghost Sightings on Hangman’s Hill? Residents of Uptown claim to have seen human shapes in the thick fog emanating from Hangman’s Brook…” It couldn’t be a coincidence, could it?\nThen the realization dawns on you—if it is witches you seek, the only place you can be certain to find them is six feet underground, in the place where professed witches were executed all those years ago. Searching for specters in a graveyard may not be your safest bet, but you’re not sure one can stay safe in this city anymore."

You agreed, though you would soon come to regret this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck, she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune. Judgment. Temperance. Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

More of the hooded figures emerge from the tree line, eager to defend their leader. “Interloper!” one calls you, pulling off her hood and pointing a gnarled wooden rod in your direction. Her bright-red hair glows in the firelight, embers dancing about her extended hand. “They’re the ones from before, High Priestess: the ones who interfered with our great work.”\nThe “High Priestess” holds up a single hand, and a hush falls over the other witches. “As always, I admire your perseverance, sister. But I do not believe these are the ones you speak of,” she replies to the red-haired accuser. You lower your weapons as several of the hooded figures approach and surround their leader. They begin chanting in a soft tone as they examine her wounds. The red-haired witch crosses her arms and watches you with a hard glare, her gaze never straying far from you. “I am Anette,” says the leader of the coven, “and these are my sisters. Tell me: Who are you, and why are you here?”\nYou explain how you awoke in the woods, how you were attacked by terrible creatures, and how you came to the center of this circle in order to break the spell surrounding the woods. Anette’s eyes narrow as she hears your story. “That is impossible. The circle was closed. None could enter the woods while we were completing our spell.” She grits her teeth. “You must go at once. This is not your place.”\n“But, High Priestess!—” the red-haired witch exclaims, only to be interrupted by Anette’s gaze. The two lock eyes, a battle of wills that quickly proves Anette victorious.\n“Stand down, Erynn,” Anette says with a firm, motherly tone, as though admonishing a child. She turns her attention back to you as the witch named Erynn lowers her head in defeat. “Go. You’ve broken the spell, just as you desired. You can leave the woods now. But I give you one final warning: cross us again, and we will not be so merciful.”\nYou begin to protest, but before you are able to utter a single word, a dark gale snuffs out the fire at the center of the clearing. Shadows from beyond the tree line suddenly twist and coil into the clearing, tugging at the edges of the witches’ cloaks. One by one, the shadows twist and pull each of the witches into the darkness beyond. In moments, they are gone. You are left with only the soft glow of moonlight to guide you home.",

      "text": "The Unvisited Isle lies in the midst of the Miskatonic River, in between two of the bridges that span the river and connect the Downtown and Rivertown neighborhoods of Arkham. Overgrown with vines, thorns, and unnatural underbrush, the island is home to no residents and very few fauna. Rows of mysterious stone pillars stand sentry throughout the island, rising high above the treetops. Though many theories abound, none know for sure what purpose these stone pillars serve, or who built them. Very few dare to venture onto the shores of the enigmatic island, and those who do return with strange tales: bonfires in the woods at the darkest hours of night—stone altars with deep carvings impossible to translate—empty woods devoid of life, save for the stark-black ravens and whippoorwills who perch on the tree branches and watch trespassers with eager eyes. Unfortunately for you, the stakes are too high for you to heed these many warnings.\nThe streets of Arkham are emptier and quieter than you have ever seen them before. A familiar grey mist has enveloped the town. The haze grows denser and thicker the closer you get to the river. You move with haste, not wanting to encounter any others on your way to the site of the ritual, whether they be living or dead. You find several rowboats moored by the docks and climb aboard one of them. With the waters unnaturally still and barely any current carrying the boat, rowing toward the island should be a simple endeavor. Even so, the dense fog makes it difficult for you to get your bearings. Soon, you are completely enclosed by the grey mist, unable to see the banks of the river or the coast of the island. Shapes emerge from the fog. Ripples appear on the surface of the water. The gaze of the watcher is upon you.\nJust then, a pillar of spectral energy ascends into the sky, clear as day even through the haze. The shapes all turn their attention to this beacon, and you sense the watcher’s gaze slipping from your soul. The rite has begun. You row faster, using the light to guide you. It is time to decide once and for all why you have come—are you here to aid the Silver Twilight Lodge? Or to disrupt them?"

Her body writhes in torment, but none of the other witches step forward to help, instead watching with equal parts terror and fascination.

We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and we are the only ones who can stop it. You know the creature I speak of.” You nod in affirmation.\n“Here is what we know: it was the witches who brought this abomination upon Arkham. We tried to stop their ritual, but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in binding it. Now it is loose, and we must finish what we started before the witches are able to do the same. But first, I understand you may have some information for us, as well. Please, hand over what you have found. It is important that we collaborate in order to understand this situation.”"

He clenches his jaw and glares at you for a moment, his cold blue eyes staring daggers into yours. “That is disappointing to hear. But perhaps it is my fault; I should not have imposed such a heavy burden on a neophyte to the Order.”\nMr. Sanford rises to his feet, and the other members of the Order follow suit. He addresses the other members of the Inner Circle: “All right. We have no more time to spare. The ritual must be completed at once. We shall use the same site as before—the central pillar of the Unvisited Isle, where the barrier between this world and the next is thinnest. It is likely that the anomaly will pursue us there, so act with caution.” Then he turns back to you. “We will require your assistance as well, of course. The device you hold is the key to binding the revenant. You must use it properly when the time comes. Do you understand?” You nod in affirmation. Taking a deep breath to steel your nerves, you prepare for the journey to the Unvisited Isle—a journey toward death itself."

You demand an explanation, but the elderly man cuts you off with a scowl. “Yes, yes. You speak of the incident last week. That was the creature’s first manifestation, and the arrival of the dark mist, which you encountered inside.” He glances at the front door to the manor and clears his throat. “The Lodge was not involved in the disappearances that occurred that night,” he explains after a short pause. “But we couldn’t exactly go to the police and tell them a creature made of mist kidnapped four people in Mr. Meiger’s household, could we? So, we had to take matters into our own hands. We suspected that creature was drawn to the crowd, so we recreated the incident in order to understand what happened—to discern its motives.” The decision to host another event at Mr. Meiger’s estate so soon after the disappearances makes sense to you now. As much as you hate to admit it, there is some logic to the plan the Lodge put into action, although you don’t particularly like being used as bait. Who knows how many innocent bystanders were put in mortal danger? Even if the goal was noble, was it worth the sacrifice?\n“I hope you understand that our organization only seeks the betterment of humankind. There are harsh truths that lie beyond our five senses,” Mr. Sanford says, his expression grim. “If we are to survive and prosper, we must adapt. We must learn. We must understand. That is what our order seeks to achieve—a greater understanding of the world around us. A worthy pursuit, don’t you agree?”"

He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before continuing. “A great loss for our order, but one we anticipated. Gather the Lodge’s belongings from inside the estate, and I will deal with the consequences.” The knight nods and heads back inside. Carl’s cold blue eyes turn back toward you. “As for you, I would ask you to leave this place at once. You have done enough harm as it is.” Before you can protest, he commands the other men nearby to escort you off the premises, and you have little choice but to comply."

The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\nThe cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\nNO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n“Real or imagined, your fate approaches all the same.”"

This may be the most foolish thing you have ever done, you think to yourself. But your instinct proves to be the right move: the creatures descend on black leathery wings, landing on the wet grass in front of you. One lowers itself until it reaches the height of your shoulders, offering its back to you. Swallowing the very last of your doubts and your fear, you climb aboard the creature. With a swift flap of its wings, it carries you off into the void, beyond the limits of space…to the domain of Azathoth."

Because Circuitous Trail is a location that is not connected to the Expedition Camp, it is placed next to the exploration deck, and Ursula draws the next card in the exploration deck. This time, she draws the Low on Supplies treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Circuitous Trail that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action.

How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\nAlejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private. I’ll have to decide tonight; after tomorrow, there won’t be time to change my mind…"

I have no doubt Alejandro will uncover the answers to these questions, given enough time.\nAs for me, my role in this endeavor has ended. However, I have yet to relax. My thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths. When I walk through the streets, I find myself drawn toward the museum without realizing it, as though possessed to see the relic once again.

When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet…I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures they encountered…” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for all of us. Read this journal, and if you can, please keep an eye on my colleague.” You agree to help, but his worry does not fade. “I only hope that I am not damning you to a similar fate by asking for your aid.”\nYou spend the remainder of that night studying the expedition journal, your mind swimming with thoughts of strange serpent-creatures and Aztec warriors. Long after Harlan has left, a loud knocking at the door startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in the morning. Who could possibly be at your door at this hour?

After all, you’ve read and re-read the journal’s description of Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior. She lets out a heavy sigh and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever they did, you have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will all cease to exist.”"

Does she speak for you? Or for herself, as well?\nIchtaca rises to her feet after some time. “I trust you to take the first watch. Be on the lookout for serpents. They are surely on the lookout for us.” Your camp is quiet for the remainder of the night, but for the soothing crackling of the campfire and the choir of chirping insects whose singing fills the night air."

He’d said he had a job offer for me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect.\nHarlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers.\nAlejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this— or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along.\nThe way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer. Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."

Of course, I gave my full account to Harlan—who I suspect is the only person willing to vouch for my story—but I have not sat down to record it on paper until now. Perhaps I would rather these events had been a figment of my imagination.\nIn truth, I have no idea how we made it out of the caverns beneath the jungle alive. Simply reaching the abyssal place was a hellish ordeal. My memory of our return trip is muddled and disarrayed. We scrambled in the dark for what seemed like ages. We were out of food, out of supplies, out of hope—but somehow, we found a way out.\nOur reward for preventing calamity was scorn and ridicule. No upstanding paper or university would publish our findings, and of course we possessed no proof of our expedition save for our scars and nightmares. I wish I could say that my memory of these events has faded with each passing day, but I will never forget the alien city we explored in our conical bodies, the serpents that pursued us in red-litten Yoth, the formless abomination that lived in the depths of the Earth…\nPerhaps that is why I fear making a written account of our findings—because these memories will crystallize and become etched in my mind, forever damning me to a life of terror and dismay. Still, the world needs to know what we saw. What we did.",

Your recent investigations in Arkham uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail went cold soon after. The “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but vanished from the city. Its members left behind little information as to their next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever, the Eztli warrior sits in the passenger seat next to you. She is tense and coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her little comfort."

He remains huddled in the back seat of the car, his knees keeping the journal still, his brows furrowed in thought. “This ‘Brotherhood’ is the least of our concerns,” he says with an air of finality. “I’ve been trying to decrypt the glyphs the device bears. The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\nIchtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\nCrossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

You peruse the archives of the city’s libraries and universities, but come up empty- handed. You can’t find any of Alejandro’s former colleagues in the city, and even his enemies refuse to speak to you, save for one: a woman named Padma Amrita, who studied Alejandro’s work before he came to Arkham. She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\nPadma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs.\nOnce she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation…"

A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\nYour head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back.

The maw in the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\nIt is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing…Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains unspoken: In the haze of broken timelines and unexplainable phenomena, the path you saw was “one future.” A future you intend to fulfill.",

They are horrifying to look upon, but they do not harm you as you expected they might. Your first few days are spent restrained and questioned by the creatures, several of which are somehow able to communicate in English. Others reproduce your language using an odd futuristic machine, played like a musical instrument. You are reminded strangely of the jazz piano at the Nightingale. It is only then that you realize your body has been altered. You have no hands or fingers to play the keys, no legs to walk upon, no lungs to scream out. You are one of them now, one of the creatures that has taken you captive, and your original body is nowhere to be seen.\nDespite your captivity, the creatures do not seem intent on harming you. Instead, they merely interview you, asking all manner of questions about a broad range of topics: your society, your profession, your technology, your ecosystem, your human body. Their thirst for knowledge is unyielding, unending. Their questions range from the mundane to the complex. They implore you to write copiously in your own language, taking anything you write to store away in their vast archives. You are informed that you will be able to roam the city freely if you comply."

It seems more concerned with preventing you from harming your body than preventing you from escaping. After many days of captivity, you find a way to use this to your advantage. You struggle so hard against your restraints that they pierce into your leathery, cold flesh, drawing out a bit of viscous slime-blood. Your guard quickly apporoaches, clicking its claws together repeatedly. It undoes your restraints, and the moment it does, your claw appendages strike at what you believe to be the creature’s throat.

You push the nurse away and rise to your feet, suddenly puzzled and disoriented. Despite the nurse’s protests, you wobble feebly out of the room. You are in a hospital, its white halls smelling faintly of disinfectant and other chemicals. Just moments prior, hadn’t you been exploring some kind of underground cavern?… You cannot recall.\n“Excuse me? Come back, you must rest!” The nurse calls out to you, gripping your forearm and pulling you back to your cot. She examines you closely while you recover from the shock of being transported so far in so short a time. “Who is Alejandro?” she asks, and you struggle to recall. The name doesn’t ring a bell.\nYou ask the nurse how you came to be here, wondering why she isn’t surprised at your sudden appearance. “Why, you admitted yourself to St. Mary’s just last night. Do you not remember?” You have no memory of this, and you are starting to grow concerned. “You were acting a little strangely, if I may be so bold. And you spoke in a strange fashion, almost as if English weren’t your first language. But now I see that you probably just drank a little bit too much.” She notices your questioning expression and smiles. “Don’t worry. We get that kind of thing quite often these days, now that all the bars and pubs are on the up-and-up again.”\nYou examine your face in the mirror. You are tired and older than you remember. Something important lies on the very edge of your memory, fuzzy and blurred. It takes about a minute before the significance of the nurse’s last statement catches up to you. Turning back toward the nurse, you ask what year it is, terrified of the answer.\n“Why, 1934 of course. My, you must have had a heck of a night!” She chuckles.",

The stone floor finally levels off, and the choking tunnel walls open to reveal a labyrinthine network of immense, far-reaching caverns. Littered throughout the caverns are the ruins of a vast city, the likes of which you have never seen. The elaborate stone architecture has been worn away by ages of abandonment, but you sense that there is a history here that runs deeper than you can even fathom. When you turn around to question Ichtaca, you notice a faint yellow glow in her eyes, her pupils narrowed and contracted. “Yoth…the last refuge of Valusia…” she quietly intones.\nJust then, a terrifying roar echoes throughout the cavern. The walls and floor shake with tremendous force, and the red glow that permeates the area brightens. A flood of hisses emerges from the tunnels all around you. Ichtaca walks to the edge of a nearby precipice and looks out over the vast depths. “He is here. I feel his presence. The Father of the Serpents…<b>Yig</b>.”"

You may have inherited it from far more powerful forces, but it is humanity’s time, not theirs.” You don’t completely understand what she is saying, but you understand the implication.

But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\nWe ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple. Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?"

I convinced two of the other members of the expedition, José and Andrea, to venture in after the others…But now I fear a terrible fate has befallen them, as well.\nThankfully, my gambit was worthwhile. While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\nIn the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device. The orb was made of an unnatural steel, attached delicately to its bronze frame. It pulsed with power in my hands and glowed with a dim blue light. Any fool could tell that it was not made by the Aztecs, but the other members of the expedition could not even begin to understand its true significance. The ruins started to crumble around me as I left, but it mattered not. The relic was all that mattered now.\nWith the artifact in tow, I returned to camp and told the others it was time to depart. Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle.

José had brought some TNT from the trucks, and there was more than enough to level the damned place.\nThat night, we put on a hell of a fireworks show. The jungle protested. Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\nJosé was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\nWith the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\nMaria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City. Even now I do not feel safe: who could, after seeing what we have seen?\nTo hell with the Eztli and to hell with this forsaken place.",

We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.\nThe dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.\nAlready one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds."

Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger and hate, hunting us relentlessly.\nPerhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. I thought Alejandro would be excited to learn more about them, but he was more disturbed than fascinated. I suppose he has a right to be incredulous. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\nThe serpent creatures chased us for what seemed like days. Finally we were able to find our way back to camp, but the price was steep. We had lost all progress we had made, and many of us were injured or afflicted by serpent venom.

They hunted us relentlessly, wielding primitive weaponry and communicating in sharp hisses.\nPerhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. The warrior named Ichtaca was particularly intriguing. We were able to defuse the initial encounter with her, and surprisingly, she helped guide us through the jungle, only to disappear mysteriously when we reached the ruins. I have a feeling we have not seen the last of her.\nAlejandro did not agree with our decision to trust the Eztli warriors. He’s decided to stay at camp until further notice, disturbed as he is by their presence. I thought he would be excited to learn more about them, but I expect this discovery defies even his broad-minded theories. I suppose he has a right to be distrustful. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\nWe have cleared a route to what Alejandro believes is the main temple of the ruins. There is little time to rest. The serpent creatures seem intent on stopping us, so we cannot tarry any longer than necessary. Soon we will enter the ruins to see what secrets they hide.",

According to the article's source—who goes unnamed—the mansion has become a tangled mess of overgrowth and serpents. The article reports that a recent expedition returned with several strange artifacts in tow, meant to be displayed in the Hastings manor. You wonder if this has anything to do with your expedition to find the Eztli. Even if these events are unrelated, your investigation might connect you with others who can assist you in turn."

A map of Central America lies on the table before you, marked with the previous expedition’s trail. “I have heard of this place, but its exact location is not known to me.” Once again, your mysterious guide appears to know more than she lets on.\nWith no other leads to follow, you are left with no choice.

I seek only to preserve my own record of these events, for I do not wish the passage of time to erase them completely. After all, these are not my memories, but the memories of my other self: the self who ventured through time and space to save humanity.\nIt is difficult to explain how we did what we did. After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember.

Lately it feels as though life has dealt you a bad hand, but you’re often able to turn terrible hands into winning ones. Who needs skill when Lady Luck is on your side?\nYour game of choice is blackjack. Somehow the right cards tend to come up at the right time, and you try to hide your elation when the dealer busts yet again. You seem to go on a hot streak every night as stacks of chips grow ever taller in front of you. Such hot streaks go a long way in paying your debts, but your luck often draws the ire of both the dealer and fellow players alike. You know when to stop.\nOver the years, you’ve acquired a reputation for winning that some call “cheating.” As a result, you’ve been forced to keep a low profile and gamble at a rotating list of venues. There is one venue which you revel winning at over all others: the Clover Club. Vast amounts of money are at stake every night at the speakeasy, but it’s controlled by the O’Bannion gang. Intimidating. Unscrupulous. Ruthless. No one wants to draw the attention of the gang, as your reputation surely does.\nBut the Clover Club has a bottom line that, above all else, must be maintained. The brazen O’Bannions are not fond of being taken advantage of, and will use any means necessary to prevent it. Here, the house always wins.\nSurely that will change tonight. You pull your collar up and walk into La Bella Luna. The restaurant is virtually empty. A faint sound of bombastic music is coming from the back of the establishment. It’s clear where all the patrons are. All you can think about is getting a drink and winning big…"

One of magick and majesty, of conquest and persecution. The moment you found that strange, old key—the moment you recognized the filigree along its handle, the pattern of its teeth—you knew those dreams weren’t dreams at all, but memories. Memories of another life. Of a place called “Hyperborea.” And as the memories returned, the magic did, too.\nFor months you practiced in secret, delving into your memories and honing your powers. But lately, your dreams have turned dark and grisly. Your former self was not as caring or forviging as you. She was ruthless. Power-hungry. Terrible to behold. You’ve taken it upon yourself to wield these strange powers only to help others, and not to hurt them.\nBut you’re not the only one whose memories have started to return. Elspeth Baudin first visited the diner a few weeks ago. In the beginning, she was just a patron like any other. She ordered eggs, bacon and a black coffee, not unlike many of the other customers at Velma’s. But there was something in her eyes— some spark of recognition or curiosity—that made you wary of her.\nThen came the questions.\nFirst, she asked about the key you wore on a chain around your neck. You gave her your best smile and told her your usual lie—that it was a family heirloom, a harmless trinket with no worth but its sentimental value. But that didn’t deter her. She started prying about your life, about your family…about your dreams.\nElspeth was no normal patron. She wasn’t making small talk. She was looking for answers, just the same as you. So you did some digging of your own. But there were no records of Elspeth being a resident of Arkham, and the few people you found who knew of her spoke only in hushed, frightened voices, and gave you very little to work with.\nThen came a call from the Curiositie Shoppe in Northside. Elspeth had been searching for more artifacts like your own “hierloom,” even going so far as to utter the name Hyperborea. She is searching for something that can unlock more of her memories, just like you…but she is <i>not</i> like you. That sinister smirk of hers, the way her contacts trembled with fear at the mention of her name—you shudder to think what somebody with foul intentions could do with the sort of powers your memories hold…"

The impact was all that was talked about in the papers, but not much was known aside from the enormous crater and the effect it had on the countryside. Nobody was allowed to leave the town, and only those approved by the shadow government agency was allowed to enter. Those unfortunate few included high-ranking government agent, and a team of researchers from the nearby Miskatonic University, who were summoned to investigate the meteor itself. For the rest of the town's inhabitants, it was a strange occurence, nothing more… that is, until the meteor <i>hatched</i>.\nI saw it with my own eyes. When the anomaly emerged, the first thing it did was devour the team of researchers who have been sent to collect and study samples from the meteor. The next thing it did was devour their lab equipment. Then Ron Graham's tractor. Then his house, in its entirety. It continued to grow and spread, devouring everything in its path. I barely escaped with my life.\nWhen the army arrived, they thought they could kill it with bullets and shells. Everything they threw at the creature was devoured, one round after the next. Then it split into hundreds of smaller pieces of itself, and the army was quickly overwhelmed. While the battle raged on, myself and others back in town saw lights and shapes in the sky above. Something was up there, waiting. Biding time.\nThe quarantine still holds, and we're stuck in the middle of it. It won't be long before the anomaly has grown large enough to devour everything in Blackwater. And if that happens, who could possibly stop its rampage?"

You thought you would be tracking down smugglers and mobsters, not imaginary monsters. But the longer your absurd cases remain open, the more you begin to think maybe they aren’t so absurd, after all. And perhaps that means the monsters aren’t imaginary, either.\nThe Bureau has countless guidelines for handling cases of all sorts, but it is eerily silent on the matter of human sacrifices. So when you were told about the bodies found inside the Black Cave, you weren’t sure where to begin. Questioning the locals and loved ones of the deceased yielded nothing of value. The evidence left behind in the cave was unhelpful, to say the least—offerings and writings proclaiming the sacrifices to be gifts, along with depictions of a monstrous tree. So you did what you do best: you put your nose to the ground and found the thread connecting all of the deaths.\nOne man lies at the center of all of the victims: Mr. Damien Grey. The congressman is not from Arkham, has no relatives or loved ones in the area, and is on no committee that would require his presence in town. And yet, he’s been staying in Arkham for the past few months, his purpose unknown. And he is connected to each of the victims through no more than two degrees of separation, which smells fishy to you. Fishier still is the police escort that follows Mr. Grey through town 24/7, despite the fact that there have been no threats on the congressman’s well-being.\nYou have to get to the bottom of this mystery, and soon. Now you see that damned tree everywhere. More people go missing by the day, and some have even claimed to see goatlike monsters prowling the alleyways. But if Mr. Grey is indeed behind this, you’ll have to be careful. Falsely accusing a politician would certainly spell the end of your career. Time to do what you came to do: dig up the proof, discover the truth, and bring the culprits in for questioning. Every “i” dotted, every “t” crossed."

Called himself Zanni. Said nothing except the 'carnival is coming'; whatever the hell that meant. Wasn't until the next day we found the victim's body. Defense wanted him in a straitjacket.

The unmarked envelope had arrived just yesterday, promising a welcome solution to a vexing affair.\nIn the past few weeks, several collections of esoteric artifacts in Arkham have been ransacked, culminating in the murder of an employee of the Miskatonic Historical Society. Your contacts have informed you that similar burglaries have taken place in Boston, Innsmouth, and New York. Strangely, nothing has been reported missing as yet except for a few records and books. What could these people be looking for? You have a growing fear that it is something dastardly indeed.\nWith leads running dry, hopping aboard an ocean liner in response to a note from an unknown sender seems only one step above a wild goose chase, but it's the best chance you may get. With that in mind, you grab the tickets and head out the door."

From the sly grin spreading across her face, you could tell she smelled a story.\nThe headline was sensaltionalist. Three killings in nine days was enough to spook a town, sure. But you doubt all of New Orleans is gripped by terror, or even knows about the killings. Still, something piqued your interest. \"Lady Esprit,\" the Voodoo priestess from the article, claimed that a malign curse had taken root in the bayou.\n\"There's something to this, isn't there? I know that look,\" Minnie said. You weren't sure. If Lady Esprit was right, this \"roux-ga-roux\" wouldn't stop killing at three, that's for sure. But curses? Wolf-people?

Too many people have whispered about the Excelsior…and to make matters worse, it seems the stories have only grown more unsettling in the last week. It’s time somebody looked into it all.\nYou’ve tried going to the police, but the grizzled and world‑weary Sergeant Monroe has dismissed you every time. You’ve been left to investigate on your own. Asking around at all the local hot-spots yields no leads. Velma’s Diner, Hibb’s Roadhouse, La Bella Luna; Each visit leaves you with only more questions. That is, until today.\nWhile walking down Central Avenue in Downtown, minding your own business, you bump into a man in a long trench coat. You begin to apologize, but he simply continues walking briskly away from you. It isn’t until you return home that you find the note in your pocket—one that wasn’t there before.\n<center><fancy>I have answers</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>Room 225. Tonight.

He is carrying a stack of dirty dishes. In your hand is a glass of water. You don’t remember ordering it, nor do you remember how long you’ve been here. And where <i>is</i> here, exactly? You spin around in your chair and realize you’re in the restaurant of the Excelsior Hotel. A few other diners are present, catching an early dinner and minding their own business. The soft light of an autumn afternoon filters in through the windows, and the general din of activity can be heard from the lobby. You turn and briefly glance back at the waiter before reaching in your pocket and dropping a quarter on the table, heading for the lobby. Your legs feel like jelly. As you stumble out of the restaurant, other guests view you with concern. The security guard in the corner watches you like a hawk. You head over to the front desk, steadying yourself against it. The concierge approaches, but you recoil at the recognition of his face. The hotel is operating as if nothing happened. But that can’t be. Everything you saw was true, right? You dash out the front door before he can reach you. You have to put some distance between yourself and this accursed place.\nWeeks pass. Nothing helps to quell the feeling in your mind that you have missed something important. This business with the Excelsior is not done, not by a long shot. You begin your investigation anew, asking around town for the latest rumors regarding the hotel. More missing staff. More sudden closures. Guests who never arrived. Guests who <i>never</i> left. It’s all too much.\nStanding on a lonely street corner in Northside, you consider your options. Streetlamps flicker to life around you as evening creeps in. Just then, a stranger bumps into you, muttering a half-hearted apology. You take a step after them before you feel something tugging at the back of your mind. No. Could it be? You stick your hands into your coat pocket. Stuffed inside is a small, folded note. You look up, but the pedestrian is nowhere in sight. You unfold the note slowly, fingers shaking from anxiety and fear.\n<center><fancy>It’s all a facade.</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>Room 225.

What really happened in the Excelsior that night?\nJust then, you hear rapping on the bars of your cell. An officer stands just outside, looking away from you. He slips a folded note between the bars of your cell.

Your fascination with horror and the macabre earned you the nickname “Spooks” among your friends and classmates. But as you grew, so too did this fascination, until it bordered on obsession. Your appetite for horror evolved from mystery and make-believe to something more. Something <i>real</i>.\nWhen you discovered John Dee’s translation of The Necronomicon, you knew you’d finally found the true horror you had been secretly yearning for. If only you’d known what would be in store for you once you’d read that dreadful tome. You would have locked it back up in Henry Armitage’s restricted collection in the Orne Library and never opened it again.\nOr so you like to think. But even you cannot doubt the allure of the <i>Kitab al-Azif</i>. The Book of the Dead. That is why, when Dr. Armitage summoned you to the Orne Library, the dread in your bones predicted precisely what had occurred.\n“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” Dr. Armitage says as he surveys the destruction. The entire restricted collection is in tattered disarray. The Necronomicon lies open on a nearby table, its metal clasps broken apart. You run your fingers along its leathery, skin-like pages. Your eyes flit along the words in a familiar dance:\n<center><i>“They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness.”</i></center>\nYour throat tightens as you realize what must have occurred. Something has been unleashed, and you are the only one who can figure out how to stop it…"

She spends her first action to explore, drawing the top card of the exploration deck. The card she draws is Desert Oasis. Because Desert Oasis is a location that is not connected to the Expedition Camp, it is placed next to the exploration deck, and Ursula draws the next card in the exploration deck. This time, she draws the Sandstorm treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Desert Oasis that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action. This time, she draws Nile River, which is connected to the Expedition Camp. Her exploration is successful. Nile River is put into play with clues on it equal to its clue value, and Ursula immediately moves from the Expedition Camp to the Nile River.</i>"

Ancient temples is one thing, but a gate to another dimension? This ‘Xzharah’ fellow? None of this can be real, right?”\nYour research and your experience says otherwise. The threat is real. There is a secret organization operating within Egypt—The Brotherhood of the Beast—and if they are not stopped, their newfound “Chosen One” will begin a campaign of destruction that ends with the Earth.\nYou insist one last time to be allowed access to the expedition’s resources. “Alright, alright,” Winlock relents. “I don’t know what it is you’re looking for out there in the desert, but I hope you find it.” You shake your head in reply.

The police thought the perpetrator to be a serial killer at first, until the sixth victim's corpse turned up as a mangled heap of meat and viscera, like a meal chewed up and spit back out. No human could have performed such a grisly murder.\nWhen similar killings started to sprout up in other cities across North America, you sought to uncover the truth. A serial killer could not be in Arkham, Providence, Montréal, and New York City all at once. This had to be the work of an organization. But that wasn't all you discovered: there were commonalities between many of the victims, sorting them into three distinct groups.\nIn Providence, many victims were older and well-educated. In Montréal, those killed lived in the woods outside the city, or had professions dealings with nature or biology in some capacity. In New York, bodies turned up deep in the sewers and underground subway tunnels, their identities shrouded in mystery.\nYou have spent the past few weeks trying to unearth the truth behind these murders and the various factions carrying them out. In this time, the conflict has grown exponentially. Massacres. Bombings. Sightings of strange ceremonies in the streets. Entities blotting out the stars in the night sky. Swarms of locust-like insects devouring people whole. Mutated lizard creatures prowling the sewers. And worse yet, while Arkham seems to be conflict's epicenter, these incidents are spreading all across the world.\nThis is no ordinary war, and not one the authorities can deal with. You are the only one who suspects the truth. Somehow, you have to find out what these factions are fighting over, and put a stop to the conflict before it consumes the entire world in its madness."

The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.\nSo far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”\n\n<right>–Minnie Klein</right>"

You ascend the staircase once more and position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun. A gun was indeed fired in the entry hall of the manor—but if that is true, how did nobody hear the shots?"

If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help…only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up.

The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home.

Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\nThe cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\nNO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n“Real or imagined, your fate approaches all the same.”"

You had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it not ringing in your head this very moment.\nThere is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where you must go… The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."

She knew the part you would have to play when you arrived here.\nSitting down at the edge of the creature’s nighted throne, you take out your flute, and begin to play.\nIn this place where time and hunger and age and weariness are mortal aspects of no concern to you, it is your duty to continue to play. Without fail. Without end.",

Slowly, quietly, you weave your wall together, stitching darkness with blood, blood with souls, souls with onyx stone. It takes ages to complete. When you are done, your reward is oblivion. A stillness and silence so pure, so perfect, no disturbance can penetrate it. The barrier cannot hold Azathoth—nothing truly can—but perhaps now it will not stir when fools on Earth call forth its name or draw from its power. With your task complete, you turn and face the darkness, summoning your steed. It is time to go home.",

But despite the gloomy mood, progress continues in the sleepy town of Arkham. The election of Nathaniel Rhodes to the United States Senate has upstanding members of the community feeling optimistic about the town’s future. And tonight, at his well-appointed estate in French Hill, a man named Josef Meiger hosts the Silver Twilight Lodge’s charity gala, an annual members-only event that will turn deadly for several attendees…"

A hush descends on the room, until only the crackle of the fireplace and whispers of gossip can be heard. “Allow me to welcome you all into my home for this year’s charity gala. We have some very upstanding citizens here tonight, and I thank all of you for your hard work and generosity.” Cheers and murmurs of agreement fill the room. Many of the guests raise their glasses to Valentino, one of the most esteemed members of the Lodge this year, who sits at the Guest of Honor table, which is nearest to the fireplace.\nJosef ’s assistant, Jerome, blends into the wall behind Josef, discreetly checking his pocket watch. In another corner of the room, the head housekeeper, Penny, walks from table to table, filling empty glasses and collecting dirty salad plates. “Each of you has done great deeds in the name of the Silver Twilight Lodge and our historic city,” Josef continues. “Next year, we will continue to shoulder this burden and do what must be done for the sake of progress.” Jerome steps forward quietly, interrupting Josef ’s speech with the unassuming confidence that comes from years of trusted service. He taps Josef lightly on his shoulder and shows him the time. “I’m afraid I am already out of time. Thank you all very much for attending,” Josef concludes, bowing. Polite applause rises from the audience, and Josef walks briskly toward the parlor, followed closely by his assistant. Two servants collect coats as latecomers trickle into the manor, and Gavriella—Josef ’s head of security—watches over the entrance with hard eyes and a clenched jaw. “Has Mr. Sanford arrived?” Josef asks curtly, tapping his polished leather shoe on the floor.\nI’m afraid not,” Jerome replies, flipping through the last pages of the estate’s guest book. “But he should be here any minute, Mr. Meiger.”\n“Good. I want there to be no problems whatsoever when he arrives; am I understood?” Josef calls out to Gavriella: “Make sure he is well protected.” Gavriella nods, patting the handle of her .45 in her shoulder holster. Josef turns his attention back to his assistant. “And have Penny make sure the main course is kept good and hot while we wait for Mr. Sanford’s arrival. Not a single slice is to be served without his presence.”\n“Not even for Mr. Rivas, sir?” Jerome asks, glancing at Josef over the rim of his thick glasses. Josef pauses for a moment, considering.\n“Pour Mr. Rivas another glass of champagne, and I am sure he will not complain. Also, I’m still waiting on those accounts I asked you about earlier today. Don’t forget,” Josef says, clapping his assistant on the shoulder before walking back into the banquet hall. Jerome nods obediently and heads upstairs.\nSoon after, the dark mist would appear, and nothing would be the same."

      "text": "You stand guard as instructed, waiting for Mr. Sanford to appear. By now, the remaining guests have filed into the banquet hall, and you can hear the sounds of merriment and drinking coming from beyond the wooden door behind you. You pay them no mind, remaining vigilant. Years of fighting and discipline have taught you to be ready for anything, even at a harmless banquet like this. Just as you begin to ponder whether your talents are being wasted under Mr. Meiger’s employ, a dark mist invades the parlor through the front door and the window frames, flooding the room. At first, you believe it to be only the evening fog seeping through the manor’s entryway, until you begin to notice that everything the mist touches seems to have decayed as though aged hundreds of years.\nYou step back cautiously, keeping a hand on the grip of your weapon just in case. Never in all your years have you seen something like this. An unnatural chill spreads throughout the room, and shivers run up your spine. As the ashen mist finishes pouring in, it coalesces into a singular form: a humanoid figure wrapped in shadows. It raises its hand and points at you with a charred, blackened finger.\nYou unholster your firearm and point it at the creature, allowing your training to take over. “Don’t come any closer!” you shout. The thing watching you from the entrance is unfazed. Its ethereal form begins to glide toward you, dark mist crawling over the carpet in its wake. “I warned you,” you growl, and a thunderous shot echoes through the parlor as you squeeze the trigger. The bullet rips a hole in the figure’s head like a rush of air billowing through a column of smoke. The mist stitches itself together, and the thing continues to drift your way, reaching out menacingly.\nNothing could have prepared you for combat with such an unnatural enemy. Faced with no other option, you turn and flee up the staircase nearby, pausing to squeeze off several more shots at the top. The bullets that make their target simply pass harmlessly through the ghostly figure, striking the door behind it. A few stray shots shatter a column of the staircase’s wooden balustrade."

You have served Mr. Meiger faithfully for almost a decade, and he trusts you with sensitive information like this—a point of pride for you. While you are often curious about your employer’s business, you have never pried into his personal matters. Not until tonight, anyway.\nYou adjust your glasses and lean forward as you turn to the page regarding Mr. Meiger’s request. Some of the names on the list you recognize: Rivas, Gensler, Fairmont, Rhodes, Wick. But many are names you have never heard of before, let alone seen affiliated with Mr. Meiger’s work: Lindquist, Konstantinov, Magro, Atkinson, Lamar…Just how deep do Mr. Meiger’s connections go?\nStrange as that may seem, it is the list of names on the page afterward that raises your hackles. While it was clear that the names on the previous page are associates of Mr. Meiger’s, or at least prominent members of the Lodge, you can only assume that this next series of names is of people your employer is…targeting. For what, you cannot say.\nYou stand next to Josef ’s desk and record the list in your pocket journal carefully, making sure to keep the names in the exact order they appear in Mr. Meiger’s ledger. You hope that your suspicion is nothing more than the absurd imagination of an overworked secretary. Still, something about all of this has you concerned. That, and the sudden draft of frigid air that has somehow wafted into the room. Your gaze naturally drifts to the window, at which point you scream out in shock and lose your balance, stumbling backward into Mr. Meiger’s desk.\nPressed up against the office window is a host of screaming faces emerging from the mist, or perhaps composed of it. Their ghostly hands press against the glass, their eyes hollow and empty. Your reading glasses clatter to the ground and shatter under your heel as you scramble to the other side of the office. You don’t realize that you dropped your pocket journal in the chaos until it is too late."

You rest your arms along the metal railing of the balcony, your fingers trembling as they hold your cigarette. The dreary gambrel rooftops and Victorian manors of French Hill span the view below you, the unlit windows hiding countless secrets.\nYou can’t remember a night in which your employer was as concerned with every little detail as he is tonight. He is normally so calm, so collected. There’s something special about tonight that has him on edge. Is it Mr. Sanford? A shudder crawls through you. For some reason, something about that man gives you the creeps. But Josef has interacted with Mr. Sanford many times before, so that cannot be the reason. What could it be that has Mr. Meiger so worried?\nYou are torn from your thoughts by the gathering of grey clouds overhead, swiftly blotting out the night sky. As the clouds grow ever closer, you begin to see shapes emerging from the vapor. You squint and lean over the railing for a better view. That is when you notice the true forms of the shapes in the mist: their screaming faces, their clawing hands, all writhing in torment and coming straight for you. You cry out in terror and back up against the wall as the mist envelops the building. A spectral shape emerges from the haze beyond the railing, dressed in bloodstained rags. It begs for rest in a croaking, gasping voice. Your only hope for escape is to retreat back into the manor and call for help…"

Your opponent sets the ivory ball back on the table with a sigh.\n“I can’t help myself around ivory. You know that, Tino,” Adam replies. You rarely see Adam Gensler except during Lodge functions, but you prefer his company to that of the stuffy business types who make up most of the Lodge these days. He makes his shot, the sudden clattering interrupting the din of conversation. “Your shot, Tino. And do try to avoid hitting the nine ball first. You’re always so overeager.” Adam chuckles as he moves to the other side of the table, making way for you.\n“That was one time, my friend, one time.” You roll your eyes. Truth be told, you’ve enjoyed coming to these events for the opportunity to give back to the community, not to hobnob with Arkham’s gentry. But hobnobbing has had its perks.\nYou lean over the table and clear your mind as you line up your shot. The room falls silent as you block out the clamor and the music, focusing all of your attention on the one ball and the corner pocket. You hold your breath and strike the cue ball. It clacks as it hits its target, and the one ball drops effortlessly into the corner pocket. “There, you see?”\nIt is only then that you realize the silence around you is not just in your mind. All of the light and warmth has been sucked out of the room. Adam is gone, along with everyone else who was present just moments before you took your shot. “Hello?” you call out. A dark mist coils about your ankles as you walk around the billiards table. “If this is a practical joke of some kind, it’s in awfully poor taste,” you remark. The only response is the deep growl that emerges from beneath the table. Morbid curiosity compels you to look underneath it, at which point a dark hound pounces onto your chest, savagely clawing at your torso. You react instinctively, pushing it off of your body as hard as you can. It lands on the billiards table, causing it to collapse under the creature’s weight. You slowly back up as the creature rises to its feet once again and jumps off the broken table, its hollow eyes gazing into your soul."

He cradles his hands behind his back, his stature impressive for his age. His discerning eyes fall on Josef. “What is the matter?”\nJosef leans closer. “It’s here, sir.

It is the one ordeal every mortal must endure, and yet the one experience no mortal could possibly describe. Ghosts? Realms beyond our mortal coil? Nothing but a last resort for a mind desperate to cling to life.\nWhen the creature next invades, you have come to a new conclusion. An icy draft surrounds you as the thing coalesces before you. Your throat constricts and tears well in your eyes, but you stand tall. You are unafraid. The creature gazes at you curiously, and the piping of infernal flutes fades into silence. It extends its clawed hand, and you shake it. You will never truly be free from its grasp, but perhaps you and the creature can work in agreement. Perhaps you can tame your fear. It doesn’t matter if the world has no point. It’s yours, damnit, and nothing will stop you from altering it to your liking."

You shudder uncontrollably as your senses slowly return to you. This box is more dangerous than you could have imagined. In the hands of the Lodge, it could have been a powerful weapon, though you’re not sure what they intended to do with it. Just then, you hear several Lodge members approaching. You quickly shift one of the room’s bookcases aside and hide behind it before they enter the room. “You’re sure you heard something in here? I don’t see anybody,” one of them says.\n“Hm…” the other pauses, presumably inspecting the room for signs of intruders. “Must have been nothing.”\n“It’s all right. We’re all a bit on edge since the trap box went missing. Come, we don’t want to be late for the ceremony. Tonight is an important night.” Their footfalls become softer as they depart. The man’s words linger in your thoughts momentarily. What did he mean by tonight being an important night? This could be just as important as the puzzle box they had been attempting to open. You quietly follow the two men as they head deep into the tunnels beneath the Lodge. You struggle to keep up with them while trying to keep your footsteps silent on the stone floor of the passageway. Finally, they enter a large door with the familiar three arrows of Silver Twilight emblazoned along its surface. Ritualistic chanting fills the hall from the other side. You approach softly, placing your ear against the door to listen in.\n“Brothers and sisters,” an elderly voice announces, “thank you for coming to this hallowed gathering. The time we have long waited for approaches.” You recognize the man’s voice – it is Carl Sanford, president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and once again we must do what has to be done in order to protect it.” The crowd responds with solemn approval. “Tonight, we will complete the ritual we began many nights ago at the center of the Unvisited Isle. Tonight, we will finally bind the revenant and learn what it knows. We must not allow the secrets of AZATHOTH to be lost to those who would do humanity harm.”\nThe cult replies with a monotone hymn, and you take this opportunity to flee the Lodge before you are discovered. The conspiracy you have unveiled leaves you with even more questions. If the revenant Mr. Sanford speaks of is what you think it is, binding it will surely protect Arkham, as he claims. But what knowledge do they seek to learn from it?…and what in the hell is an “AZATHOTH?”",

You’re not sure whether it broke as a result of the beast’s emergence or as a result of its death, but either way, it is a regretful outcome. “This didn’t work as planned,” one of the robed members of the Order states matter-of-factly as you examine the crushed puzzle box.\n“That’s a hell of an understatement,” another adds. She places a hand on your shoulder and gently pulls you away from the remains of the device. “Come on, that’s a lost cause,” she says.\nHer partner ignores your presence and stoically addresses her. “We’ll have to get to the Unvisited Isle and complete the binding rite without the trap.” She nods and takes one last look at you before the remaining Lodge members flee the building.

Understanding why they have come, you step aside and allow them to do their work.\nOne of the witches draws a circle in the dirt around Anette, while the rest bind her with tendrils of searing energy. The revenant shrieks and wails in agony, but the witches dare not cease. Finally, as their chants rise to a crescendo, Erynn pierces the sanctity of the circle with her knife, pressing firmly against the air and straining as though she were attempting to pierce solid stone. Keziah’s ghost departs in a whirl of spectral mist, dissipating into thin air with a final cry. Anette’s body, unsupported, collapses to the ground. “It’s over,” you say, placing a hand on Erynn’s shoulder.\n“No,” she replies harshly, gesturing to the sky above. The storm clouds have all disappeared, yet you count not a single star in the night sky. The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not even realized it was there. How long had it loomed over the city while you spent your time warding against lesser incursions?\nYou ask what can be done to close a breach of such size. She clenches her jaw. “I don’t know. But I know who does.” She kneels over Anette, raises her hand, and slaps her hard across the face. Anette jerks awake, startled out of her catatonic state.\n“Is this what you wanted, sister?” Erynn drags her to her feet, forcing her to look up at the catastrophe she has wrought.\n“You know it isn’t,” Anette replies, her voice ragged. “I only wanted us all to have some semblance of the strength she possessed. I had no desire to use it in the same way she did. But the spirit took control, and I could not resist.” She lowers her head in resignation. “I’m sorry, sisters. I failed us all. I was not strong enough.”",

In seconds you are surrounded by the witches of Anette’s coven. The high priestess steps forward, glaring at Carl Sanford with all of the intensity of hell itself.\n“Do not trust the word of this sinister worm,” she warns you. “Everything he has done, he has done to further his own agenda. He would gladly hold the world hostage if it meant one last chance at power.”\nDespite his wounds, Sanford rises to his feet and bellows back at her: “What hypocrisy! Do you forget that it was you and your misguided sect who started all of this? Summoning the dead, asking them for power?” He scoffs. “We would have elevated all of humanity. You sought only to elevate yourselves.” Sanford turns to appeal to your judgment one last time. “Do not be a fool,” he says quietly. “This outcome is not what the Lodge desires. Allow me to help, and together maybe we can return things to normal.”",

We shall use the same site as before—the central pillar of the Unvisited Isle, where the barrier between this world and the next is thinnest. It is likely that the anomaly will pursue us there, so act with caution.” Then he turns back to you. “We will require your assistance as well, of course. The device you hold is the key to binding the revenant. You must use it properly when the time comes. Do you understand?” You nod in affirmation.

You demand an explanation, but the elderly man cuts you off with a scowl. “Yes, yes. You speak of the incident last week. That was the creature’s first manifestation, and the arrival of the dark mist, which you encountered inside.” He glances at the front door to the manor and clears his throat. “The Lodge was not involved in the disappearances that occurred that night,” he explains after a short pause. “But we couldn’t exactly go to the police and tell them a creature made of mist kidnapped four people in Mr. Meiger’s household, could we? So, we had to take matters into our own hands. We suspected that creature was drawn to the crowd, so we recreated the incident in order to understand what happened—to discern its motives.” The decision to host another event at Mr. Meiger’s estate so soon after the disappearances makes sense to you now. As much as you hate to admit it, there is some logic to the plan the Lodge put into action, although you don’t particularly like being used as bait. Who knows how many innocent bystanders were put in mortal danger? Even if the goal was noble, was it worth the sacrifice?\n“I hope you understand that our organization only seeks the betterment of humankind. There are harsh truths that lie beyond our five senses,” Mr. Sanford says, his expression grim. “If we are to survive and prosper, we must adapt. We must learn. We must understand. That is what our order seeks to achieve—a greater understanding of the world around us. A worthy pursuit, don’t you agree?”"

The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\nThe cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\nNO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n“Real or imagined, your fate approaches all the same.”"

He leans forward and listens intently as you explain the night’s strange events, your memories still somewhat of a haze. You conclude your story, and the elderly man considers your words. “Interesting,” he says at last. “I know of this coven. They are led by a witch named Anette Mason. Their magic is no trivial thing. They have passed down arcane secrets that can manipulate the energies of the universe. It is dangerous knowledge they possess—knowledge I believe they derived from a powerful witch who fled from Salem over two hundred years ago. Does the name ‘Keziah’ mean anything to you?”\nYou nod. Everyone in Arkham has at least some passing knowledge of the witch whose ghost supposedly haunts the old condemned “Witch House” in French Hill. Most believe her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the decrepit house. Mr. Sanford’s steely gaze and humorless tone makes it clear to you that this is not the case. “Perhaps this Anette is a true descendant of Keziah, or perhaps she is simply using her name. In any event, I believe these events are connected. To that end, I have a task for you, on behalf of the Silver Twilight Lodge.” Carl Sanford rises to his feet, using his cane more for show than for balance. You rise as well, ready to perform whatever duties are necessary to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n“We need as much information about this coven as we can obtain. If there is any place that will have these answers, it is the house where Keziah herself lived all those years ago.” You nod in agreement—there are too many questions you need answered. What spell were the witches casting that night in the woods? What is their motive? And what is their connection to the creature that kidnapped those four unfortunate souls? You shake Mr. Sanford’s hand and depart for the Witch House."

One question lingers in your mind as you consider the events that have transpired: Does Keziah’s spirit linger because of the mist, or is the mist caused by her presence? Which is the disease, and which the symptom?\nThe more you delve into Arkham’s history of witchcraft and persecution, the more restless you become. Night after night, you are assaulted by terrible dreams—dreams of death and decay, of guilt and sin. There is an evil that dwells in this city, an evil that has long remained hidden in the darkness of Arkham’s past. What’s worse, your inquiry has reached an impasse. You believe that if you can find the coven of witches you saw in the woods that fateful night, you might be able to learn more about Keziah Mason or of this unspoken evil.\nAs you go through your morning routine, your eyes drift across one of the smaller headlines of today’s newspaper: “Ghost Sightings on Hangman’s Hill? Residents of Uptown claim to have seen human shapes in the thick fog emanating from Hangman’s Brook…” It couldn’t be a coincidence, could it?\nThen the realization dawns on you—if it is witches you seek, the only place you can be certain to find them is six feet underground, in the place where professed witches were executed all those years ago. Searching for specters in a graveyard may not be your safest bet, but you’re not sure one can stay safe in this city anymore."

Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

This may be the most foolish thing you have ever done, you think to yourself. But your instinct proves to be the right move: the creatures descend on black leathery wings, landing on the wet grass in front of you. One lowers itself until it reaches the height of your shoulders, offering its back to you. Swallowing the very last of your doubts and your fear, you climb aboard the creature. With a swift flap of its wings, it carries you off into the void, beyond the limits of space…to the domain of Azathoth."

Overgrown with vines, thorns, and unnatural underbrush, the island is home to no residents and very few fauna. Rows of mysterious stone pillars stand sentry throughout the island, rising high above the treetops. Though many theories abound, none know for sure what purpose these stone pillars serve, or who built them. Very few dare to venture onto the shores of the enigmatic island, and those who do return with strange tales: bonfires in the woods at the darkest hours of night—stone altars with deep carvings impossible to translate—empty woods devoid of life, save for the stark-black ravens and whippoorwills who perch on the tree branches and watch trespassers with eager eyes. Unfortunately for you, the stakes are too high for you to heed these many warnings.\nThe streets of Arkham are emptier and quieter than you have ever seen them before. A familiar grey mist has enveloped the town. The haze grows denser and thicker the closer you get to the river. You move with haste, not wanting to encounter any others on your way to the site of the ritual, whether they be living or dead. You find several rowboats moored by the docks and climb aboard one of them. With the waters unnaturally still and barely any current carrying the boat, rowing toward the island should be a simple endeavor. Even so, the dense fog makes it difficult for you to get your bearings. Soon, you are completely enclosed by the grey mist, unable to see the banks of the river or the coast of the island. Shapes emerge from the fog. Ripples appear on the surface of the water. The gaze of the watcher is upon you.\nJust then, a pillar of spectral energy ascends into the sky, clear as day even through the haze. The shapes all turn their attention to this beacon, and you sense the watcher’s gaze slipping from your soul. The rite has begun. You row faster, using the light to guide you. It is time to decide once and for all why you have come—are you here to aid the Silver Twilight Lodge? Or to disrupt them?"

A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\nAnette clenches her jaw and turns toward you. “You cannot even begin to fathom the secrets this monster now possesses.

      "text": "Anette approaches, confronting the remnant’s ethereal shell. “Sister! We are the ones who have called you here from the great beyond.” The shattered revenant turns its attention to Anette, and the rest of her coven watch in anticipation.\n“What are you doing, you fool? This spirit is no mere witch!” Carl Sanford yells out. But it is too late. Anette ignores Mr. Sanford, continuing to speak with the spectral presence. “For years we have suffered injustice after injustice. Share with me your secrets, sister. Together, as one mind, body, and soul, we can begin anew.”\nThe ghost reaches out to her with a long, skeletal arm. Anette’s sisters gasp as their high priestess steps forward and kneels before the being, offering herself. With a sudden rush of energy, the phantom soul is drawn inside Anette. She collapses to the ground, reeling from the spiritual impact. Her body writhes in torment, but none of the other witches step forward to help, instead watching with equal parts terror and fascination. Finally, Anette rises to her feet, her eyes aglow with mystical power. When she speaks, it is not her voice. “Sisters. Rejoice, for I am reborn,” Keziah says.\nCarl Sanford taps you with his cane. You were so transfixed by the events occurring in front of you that you hadn’t noticed the Lodge members slinking toward the edges of the clearing. One of the Lodge’s inner circle raises a revolver and attempts to fire, but the high priestess simply glares at him, and his arm withers and rots before your eyes. His gun clatters to the ground and he makes one final croak before he is nothing but a decayed husk on the ground. “We must leave this place at once,” Sanford says stoically. “This being possesses power over life and death itself. It will not suffer our presence any longer.”\nAnette—no, Keziah—turns her attention to you, and her eyes brighten. “You look familiar, child. Come, come. Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear from me.” She grins wickedly. Her voice is like knives driving into your soul. You hate to admit it, but Sanford is right. You turn and flee with the rest of the Lodge, hoping you are fast enough to escape the witch’s magic. \nYour escape is a blur. Witches and spirits chase you relentlessly throughout the forsaken woods. You are only barely able to make it back to the shore before they catch up to you. Other members of the Lodge are perhaps not so fortunate. Having scattered in many directions, you’re not sure how many of them escaped, and you don’t see Carl Sanford anywhere, though you suspect he had a plan for this outcome.",

With the ritual concluded, the island seems to have returned to normal—but was the ritual successful, or did it fail? You make your way to the center of the island to find out what happened. As you arrive, you find Anette and her coven heavily wounded, and the Lodge stands victorious. Carl Sanford holds a thick leather tome in his hands, its pages glowing with arcane power. “What have you done?!” Anette yells. Several members of her coven surround her. They are embattled, but you have no doubt they would lay down their life to protect their high priestess from harm.\n“What have I done? Why, I have cheated the Devil,” Sanford responds with a sinister grin. You notice the words of his tome are now glowing with a spectral radiance. “Keziah signed the Black Book of Azathoth in order to learn the secrets of the universe. A fatal error, in my estimation, for it put her in the clutches of one far more powerful than she.” He begins to read from the pages as he explains further. “She paid the price, but I shall reap the harvest.”\nAnette clenches her jaw and turns toward you. “Listen to me. You cannot even begin to fathom the secrets this monster now possesses. You must stop him, no matter the cost.”\nYou hold your tongue, but in the back of your mind, you suspect Anette is right. Sanford has tricked you. This is what he was after all along. Perhaps he considers this “protecting humanity,” but the truth is that he has endangered the lives of others over and over again in order to serve his own greed and lust for power. However, before you can confront Sanford, he turns to the other members of his Order and points to you. “This one is no longer useful,” he explains. “Kill them all.”\n“Erynn, give us cover!” Anette barks to the red-haired witch next to her.

      "text": "<i>Following scenario 1–A, the dreamers travel beyond the Enchanted Woods…</i>\nAs you travel out of the Enchanted Woods, you pass through rolling green meadows under a bright-blue, cloudless sky. You speak with the blond-haired man—who introduces himself as Randolph Carter— for several hours along your journey south. You pass through a town Randolph calls Nir and over a stone bridge spanning a wide river. Since the man seems friendly and knowledgeable about both your world and this one, you explain to him your situation: that you had followed the writings of a man named Virgil Gray to reach this strange land, in order to see for yourself the truth of his story. “There is a place in Ulthar where you may yet meet this man for yourself,” Randolph responds. “When we reach Ulthar, I will show you.”\nThe town of Ulthar is not quite what you had imagined. The border of the town is marked by a cobblestone road separating its quaint cottages from the rolling green meadows beyond. Inside the town, narrow cobbled streets are filled almost to capacity with cats of all kinds and colors, which part as you approach. Old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories arch over the hilly streets; the entire village seems a haphazard cluster of homes and old-fashioned businesses. As you reach the town square near the center of the village, Randolph stops and addresses you with a youthful smile. “Welcome to Ulthar,” he proclaims. “As I mentioned before, you are quite safe here. There is but one paramount law to keep in mind as you traverse this place: in the town of Ulthar, no one may kill a cat.” Given how utterly packed the streets are with cats, you wonder aloud if this is indeed a town run by cats. “Not quite,” Randolph replies, pondering your words, “though I suppose one might call it the center of cat society here in the Dreamlands. The reason for that law’s existence is a story for another time. First, come—I have a feeling we’ll find this ‘Virgil’ fellow you speak of at Einar’s.”\nRandolph leads you through the town square, which is surrounded by buildings adorned with cat motifs in the form of statues, signs, and even stained-glass windows. You eventually arrive at one such building bearing a sign that reads “Einar’s Place.” Inside is a medieval-style tavern filled with long wooden tables. You spot several patrons and three times as many cats. One such patron at the wooden counter feeds one of the cats small strips of dried meat. He is a handsome man in his early thirties, with short dark hair, a strong jaw, and sharp cheekbones. You recognize him instantly as the writer Virgil Gray. In the back of your mind, you wonder if this chance meeting is merely an act of fortune or something preordained, for good or for ill.\nRegardless, you approach the man and introduce yourself, along with Randolph. Virgil shakes your hand and Randolph’s with a joyful smile. “Well met, fellow dreamers!” the writer says, a hint of boyish excitement in his voice. “It is wonderful to meet more fellow believers. I had become so sick and tired of reading about my supposed ‘illness’ in the papers.”\nYou nod your head in agreement and inform Virgil that you intend to find some proof of this discovery to bring back to the waking world. “Don’t you think I tried that?” he replies, stymied. “Sadly, it is impossible for one who is asleep to bring anything from this realm into the real world. This is all imagination, you see. Ideas, concepts, fantasies. You cannot hold a thought in your hands, can you?”\nRandolph interjects. “There is a place within the Dreamlands that may hold the proof you seek. I have seen it in my dreams. I visited there three times, each time just a fleeting moment before I was snatched away by the rising sun…but try as I might, I cannot find the way again. I have spent many nights searching.”\n“Oh?” Virgil asks, intrigued. “And what is this place?”\n“It is a marvelous city,” he describes, his eyes aglow with wonder, “golden and lovely like nothing I have seen before or since. A city beyond the peaks of the unknown mountain Kadath, where no one has ever set foot before. There, veiled within the clouds and crowned by stars, lies the onyx castle of the Great Ones.”\nVirgil idly pets the cat on the countertop next to him as he is absorbed by Randolph’s tale. It is a slender creature with lustrous black fur, dark as the void of space itself. “Then we must find this place! Even if it does not have the proof we seek, it sounds like the adventure of a lifetime. Enough to fill a hundred pages, or more!”\nYou tell Virgil and Randolph that before you commit to such an adventure, you must return to the waking world and tell your companions about your experiences. Just then, another voice, cryptic and quiet, chimes: “Oh, you can’t wake up. The eye is upon you now.”\nYou and the others spin your heads around, searching for the source of the voice. The barkeeper? Another patron? Then Virgil’s black cat stretches and sits up, its piercing yellow eyes reflecting the light of the sun through the window outside. “I have waited a long time for you to seek Kadath,” it says.\n“You can talk?” Virgil says, nearly toppling over his stool as he jumps in surprise.\n“I’m a cat, you dolt. Of course I can talk,” the black cat replies, licking its paw out of boredom. “You have met a thousand cats from Ulthar, and now you are surprised?”\n“But…I thought…” Virgil wipes his brow with his palm.\n“Never mind him,” the black cat says, addressing you directly. “I assure you, you cannot cross back into the waking world until you find Kadath. It is your only way out. In the meantime, I will return and tell your companions about the quest ahead of you.” It hops off of the countertop and walks confidently toward the exit. “Though I imagine their task will be even more arduous…”"

Exhausted, you manage to rise to your feet, brushing off the dirt caked on your clothing. “You’re lucky you weren’t harmed before we arrived,” a human voice calls out to you. It belongs to a blond-haired man in a brown traveling coat, who leans against a nearby tree. “These woods are not forgiving to the faint of heart.” The scarred cat walks to the man’s side, and the man leans over to pet its back.\nYou ask the man where you are and how he came to this place, but he cuts you off. “I will explain in due time. For now, we must follow the path to the town of Ulthar. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your ordeals.” He turns to the cat and utters a word in an odd language—a password of sorts, you suspect—but the cat simply wanders off toward a hedge, where you see several other cats banded together. “Do it yerself,” it replies.\n“Don’t mind the cats,” the man says to you quietly as the cats depart. “They are useful allies, but also independent creatures with no need for you or me. When we reach Ulthar, you may get the chance to meet others of their kind. But first things first.” Together, you leave the eaves of the enchanted forest behind.",

The creatures timidly drop their “tribute” of birds in front of the cats and quietly depart. “My apologies on behalf of the Zoogs,” the man says as he approaches. “They are curious creatures, and not usually so…agitated. It is good that we showed up when we did.” The leader of the cats jumps on a tree stump and adds, “Yes, yes. Them vile Zoogs have done their part, now let’s do ours and leave this forsaken place. What say yeh?”\nYou cannot contain your excitement. Zoogs, talking cats—everything you have read about is real. You begin to ask the man more about this world, but he cuts you off. “I will explain in due time. For now, we must follow the path to the town of Ulthar. It is a safe place, relatively speaking.

Had you known these rodent-like creatures were intelligent all along, you might have tried to communicate with them much earlier. You inform them that you are just travelers in this faraway land and that you simply wish to pass through peacefully. The creatures chitter among themselves for a moment: “They are kind!” “They are not with the black cat after all!” “Summon the Council of Sages!” After a short while, several more of them appear, each with withering grey fur and a frail, thin body. The eldest one peeks behind you and states that they will aid you if you get the cats to leave.\nSomehow, you contain your disbelief and politely ask the cats to come back another time. “All right,” the scarred cat replies, “but you ain’t seen the last of us.” The cats retreat to the edge of the woods, though their human companion stays behind with you. Once the cats are out of earshot, one of the elders offers you a gourd of what appears to be fermented tree sap, which you accept graciously.\n“It is the wine of the moon-tree,” the man behind you explains quietly, stepping forward. “The Zoogs do not give such gifts lightly. They are curious creatures, but not without wisdom. Now that you may speak freely with their elders, try asking them a question. They know more of the dealings of this land than you might think.”\nYou describe the author Virgil Gray and ask the Zoogs if they have seen a man fitting that description pass through these woods. You add that he would have walked this path many times. A hush falls over the Zoogs, and some of them immediately depart into the deep foliage. “We have met this human,” one of the elders replies with a flutter just louder than a whisper. “He often comes this way. He is kind but foolish. Take the road to Ulthar. You may meet him.” Then it adds with a low growl: “…but beware the cat that follows him. All cats are liars, but the black cat especially.” You thank the ancient Zoog for its wisdom and depart, led by the blond man and his feline escort. The cats eye you suspiciously after your discussion with the Zoogs. The man breaks the tension. “If you are heading to Ulthar to find this friend of yours, allow me to guide you there. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your travels.”\nZoogs. Talking cats. This can’t all be a figment of your imagination. Somehow, you can see a layer of truth beneath all of this absurdity. For better or for worse, the Zoog council has confirmed the reality of your situation: the Dreamlands are real, and Virgil Gray is here.",

      "text": "Over the next few days, you learn more about your captors, but nothing about the black galley’s destination. It seems the Corsairs who hunted you down and captured you were only agents—or perhaps slaves—of a much greater evil: a race of greyish-white toad-like creatures with no eyes and slippery skin concealed beneath a loose disguise of silken clothing. You notice the creatures tend to stay below deck, and none of them deign to interact with you at all. Despite their disguises, the mere sight of one makes you retch. If they are indeed the masters of the Corsairs, this cannot bode well for you. You are kept apart from Virgil, and suspect he is on a different ship entirely.\nMore days pass. You have no way of telling how long it’s been since your capture. You have been kept well fed—that is, if being forced to eat bitter porridge from a dirty clay bowl counts as “well fed.” What concerns you most is the ship itself. Though you are sure it’s still moving, you no longer feel it rock back and forth as the waves push it from side to side, nor do you hear the sounds of the ocean or of gulls cawing over the coast. In fact, you hear very little at all now: only the occasional commands of one of the beasts from below deck, and the shouting of Corsairs in reply. No churning sea. No wind in the sails. Nothing at all.\nPanic seizes your mind. What if you are destined for some strange port from which there can be no return? Could they have have sailed off the face of the planet itself? You have to do something. Escape, somehow. You try desperately to come up with a plan of action, but in vain. Corsairs relentlessly patrol the brig, and even if you managed to slip your bonds and sneak past them, where would you go?\nJust as you begin to lose hope, a familiar face descends from the top deck. It is the ship captain you hired in Dylath-Leen: a chubby, middleaged fellow with a bushy beard and long hair pulled into a bun atop his head. He peeks around, realizes he is alone with you, and runs to your side. “I am so sorry, my friends,” he stammers quietly. “I had no idea who I was dealing with. I was tricked, I swear. I did not know that they were…I did not know…” he trails off, red-faced with guilt. You aren’t entirely sure what he means, but obviously he had something to do with your capture. Regardless, he is your only chance at escape. You tell him all will be forgiven if he helps you. He ponders for a moment, looks around, then finally nods and slices through your bonds with a curved knife.\nFreedom has never tasted so sweet. You stretch your aching muscles and search nearby for your belongings, but there is little time to waste. Keeping a lookout, your rescuer whispers, “There may be a rowboat you can use on the top deck, but we’ll have to be quiet as mice. If they spot—” his voice suddenly catches in his throat, along with a sharp, jagged blade. He makes a dreadful gurgle as blood wells in his mouth, and he collapses. Behind him, a Corsair flashes a sadistic grin at his next victims: you."

Or perhaps not. For the sake of your own sanity, it may be better not to dwell on suspicions of betrayal.\n“How does one even sail to the Moon?” you ask, befuddled. By now, you are no stranger to the oddities of the Dreamlands, having spent weeks exploring its cities, wilds, and places stranger still. Even knowing the laws of physics and astronomy should not apply here, you struggle to imagine how one might sail a ship into space.\n“It will be a long journey,” Randolph answers. “Far across the sea lie the Basalt Pillars of the West. Between these pillars, the ocean plunges off the edge of the world. If we sail off of the precipice between them, we can cross the void of space itself.”\nYou shouldn’t be surprised that the world of Earth’s Dreamlands is flat; after all, everything else here is a fiction, too. Still, you are incredulous. “I have sailed this route before,” Randolph says, sensing your skepticism. “But I fear this time it might be a one-way trip, especially without a crew. We may need to find an altogether different way to unknown Kadath. Are you prepared?”\nYou look to the horizon, where the cerulean sea meets the sky. Somewhere out there, your aid is needed. What’s more, the proof you seek may lie across the sea—over the edge of the very world itself. You prepare to embark."

Virgil tries his best to resist, but Randolph gives in, knowing that his resistance is futile. You are brought into a large domed temple on the dark side of the Moon and forced to kneel before one of the moon-beasts. It is dressed in grey robes and heavy wrappings, but you see its true visage beneath: its slippery, clammy flesh and its drooling, bulbous lips. “Wonderful,” it praises its henchmen. “Our master will be pleased.” Behind you, Corsairs prevent your escape, while a row of winged things on either side of you squawk rhythmically and flap their wings. A preparation, you suspect, for an unpleasant journey.\nThe moon-beast orders its slaves to haul you onto the winged creatures. “Bring these wretches to the sacrificial pits,” it decrees. “They must be judged for their heresy. The moon lizard shall feed well tonight.”\n“What? No, this isn’t right.” Randolph grits his teeth.\nThere is a bright flash of light, and you <i>awaken</i>. You are sitting atop a comfortless and unfamiliar bed. A wave of relief washes over you at first. Have you finally awoken from this endless dream? Then the still, cold void embraces you, and you realize where you truly are. Instead of four walls and a ceiling, you are surrounded by a bright, starry cosmos. Galaxies and nebulae in the distance seem to stare back at you with unfeeling cruelty. Your bed floats along the thinnest of silver threads. Virgil’s cat sits up at your feet. “You’re not awake,” the black cat says. “Not yet.”\nAnother flash of light. The moon-beast orders its slaves to haul you onto the winged creatures. “Bring these wretches to the High Priest in the Cold Wastes,” it decrees. “They must be judged for their heresy.”\n“Worry not, my friends,” Randolph whispers to you. “Did you hear that? The Cold Wastes is the region wherein unknown Kadath lies. With any luck, they will bring us right to our destination—” Randolph is cut off as the moon-beast grabs him and pulls him to his feet.\n“No, not you. I know of you. You will be a gift. Fodder for the moon lizard. Come.” It drags Randolph away before your very eyes. His screams echo off the walls of the temple and fade as he is hauled underground. Then, borne aloft on dreadful, membranous wings, your mounts carry you into the void of space.",

You seem to know the language well, despite having never heard it before. You ask after your course, but the bearded man does not reply other than to continue his harmonious song. You plead with him to aid you in your search for unknown Kadath, believing it to be of the utmost importance. “You should not seek to disturb the gods,” the man warns, his song interrupted. “They are far greater than you or I. Do you not see the folly in your ambition?” You beseech him once more, telling him you must bring back proof of the Dreamlands, and cannot return home without the aid of the gods. “Would that be so dire a fate? Look around you.”\nYou do as the captain requests, and are met with a scene of such serene beauty that it leaves you breathless. The seas below glitter in the moonlight like an ocean of diamonds. Along the horizon, you see crystalline coastlines, blissful countrysides, lush mountain vistas, and emerald-green gardens. The air is crisp and cool as you descend below the clouds. Your heart swells with the sweet fragrance of flowers from the nearby coast. Never in all your years in “reality” have you experienced a beauty so <i>real</i>.\nMaybe staying wouldn’t be so bad. You’ve already spent weeks—no, months—in this land. There have been hardships, yes, but could you really return to your mundane reality after everything you’ve seen and experienced in this wondrous land?\nThen, far to the north, you see it. Looming just over the horizon, or perhaps beyond the dreams of Earth itself. A white peak, atop which sits an azure beacon of refracted moonlight. The bearded man follows your gaze. “So be it,” he sighs. He changes course, following now behind a celestial bird whose plumage matches the vibrant sky. “We sail to the abode of the gods themselves.”",

      "text": "<fancy>Friday, February 13th, 1925</fancy>\nSomething odd was happening in Arkham, Massachusetts.\nTypically, this would not be a surprise to the residents of the dreary New England town. Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance, however, was anything but typical.\nIt all began in the latest issue of <i>Tales from Nevermore</i>. A writer by the name of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the moon, and a curious talking cat…among other things equally difficult to believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention. Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, <i>Tales from Nevermore</i> began to receive and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the ears of experts.\nVirgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently, experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?\nYou and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong…"

He is a frail, wiry man with a long, wispy black beard, caved-in cheeks, and the pale, milky eyes of one afflicted by blindness. “Do not let your eyes deceive you,” Randolph whispers as you seat yourselves in front of the dais. “Atal is over three centuries old, but his memory is sharp as a tack.”\nYou ask the priest about your quest and about your destination: the castle Randolph described from his dreams. “You speak of the resting place of the Great Ones, high above unknown Kadath. Even I know not its true location. And that is all well and good, for the fruits of attempting to ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard from again. The gods of Kadath may seem powerless, but they are protected by the Other Gods from the Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. It would be wiser to let all the gods alone and leave this folly behind.”\nAtal’s use of the word “gods” has you curious. You wonder aloud what kind of god might exist in a place like this.\nThe priest shakes his head. “They are not our gods, but the gods of Earth, for this land is but a reflection of yours.”\nYou attempt to pry deeper into Atal’s wisdom with your questioning, but his advice does not budge. “I have already said more than I should,” he insists. “Please, for your sake, pursue this madness no further.”"

When you return, the crew and captain are nowhere to be found. There are no signs of struggle, but Virgil, who returned to the ship earlier to prepare for your next departure, is also missing.\n“I fear the worst,” Randolph mourns. “If those fiendish Corsairs captured them, they are in dire trouble. They are agents of the Other Gods from the Outside, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos <smallcaps>Nyarlathotep</smallcaps>.” The mere utterance of the name causes you to shudder, though you do not know why. You ask where they might have been taken. As if discussing any other port of call, he replies: “The beasts who command their black galleys sail from the Moon. If we are to rescue Virgil and our other companions, that is where we must go.”",

Pale light shines from atop a great black peak piercing the vibrant firmament, and you know that you approach the end of your quest. You spend untold hours ascending the snow-covered slopes until finally you reach the forbidden steps leading to the castle’s great hall. The castle stands astride a precipice that overlooks the entire continent and the ocean beyond. It is a majestic sight. Above, countless tenebrous towers loom, swathed in a vortex of snow and hail. You break a trail through the crusted snow before the castle, and it soon gives way to smooth, polished onyx. The biting wind quiets to a whistle. You are bathed in a prodigious darkness that fills the vast space. Soon there is nothing but the echoing of your footsteps on the onyx floor and the quiet, lonely stillness of the great hall. Though you have crossed no doorway, you realize now where you stand: inside the halls of the Great Ones. You expected to be met by guards, servants of the gods, or perhaps even those powerful beings themselves, but you are met only by loneliness and foreboding as chilling as the piercing winds outside. You continue forward until at last you reach the end of the hall. Here, flanked by smooth onyx pillars, you find…nothing.\nThere are no gods here. This place is long abandoned.\nVirgil is agape. “I…I don’t understand.”"

You are the one who led us on this quest to begin with.”\nRandolph smiles and places a hand on Virgil’s shoulder. “Yes, I am.

Will you help me right this wrong?” the figure asks. Before Virgil can reply, it pulls its arm back and drives a razorsharp blade of onyx through Virgil’s chest.

Not because I did not believe, but because I was frightened. Is that why the key eludes me? Is that why I can no longer dream?” The realization hits him, clear as day. “I know where we have to go.

You think of your companions, trapped somewhere in a perilous dream far from home, and the key’s glow intensifies, swallowing you as completely as the creature swallowed Randolph. Everything goes white.\nWhen you awaken, you lie on a flat stone platform overlooking a steep, straight staircase that descends into unknown depths. Behind you, the stairway curls upward into a stone spire that ascends into a hazy mist. In both directions, the entirety of the cavern is dimly lit with grey phosphorescence. You search for the Silver Key, but it has vanished. There is no sign of Randolph Carter.\nIt is clear you are no longer in the waking world. Perhaps the key transported your physical body into the Dreamlands, as Randolph claimed it could. But this place is nothing like the mystical forests, charming medieval villages, and majestic panoramas of which Virgil Gray wrote in his stories. No, far from it: this cold, bleak gulf eats away your hope and replaces it with a feeling of empty, meaningless dread. You peer once more up the countless steps behind you. It seems you have no choice now but to move on, deeper into this desolate and perilous realm.",

In any event, I bear a message from your dreaming friends.”"

When you arrive, you find the black cat stuck on a patch of particularly sticky web, wriggling back and forth in a vain attempt to free itself. Even with its sharp claws, it seems to be in trouble. You lean over and pull the cat free, and it leaps from your arms to a rocky platform below, the only thing between the cat and an endless void. It hisses for a moment, then stands tall. “Did I ask for your help?” it scolds. “Well, you made it below the Sea of Pitch after all. Now look around you. See all this webbing?” You couldn’t miss it even if you tried; you are surrounded on all sides by webs, treacherous pathways across the aether. “It is a bridge between your world and the Dreamlands. If it is completed, the two will merge. Understand? Unless you want everything to look like that hospital where your friends are sleeping, you have to stop this at all costs. Nothing else matters. <i>Nothing.</i>”"

That is where you need to go to stop this world from merging with yours. Make it there in one piece, and I’ll tell you everything. But first, I have somewhere else to be. Your pals need me, too.”"

You suspect he wouldn’t have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark and barren realm, you are filled with hollow despair—an emptiness that gnaws at your heart and mirrors the bleak landscape all around you. You came here to help your friends, and now your only guide through this realm is gone. What if this was all a horrible mistake?\nYou shake these dark thoughts from your mind and focus on the path that lies ahead of you. It’s too late to dwell on what you could have done differently. This is your way forward now. Even if you cannot help your friends, even if you are too late to help Randolph, you have another mission now. Clearly this region of the Dreamlands has something to do with the creatures invading your reality. The answers must lie here. Besides, it’s not like you have much choice anymore.\nYou walk to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. This realm is staggeringly vast. In the distance, along the cliffs, you see a walled city, of all things. Among its many towers, a black spire rises so high it must pierce the surface of the Dreamlands. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below, and you can see shapes moving throughout the grey, phosphorescent light. You hope the beings who inhabit this realm are ones you might be able to reason with. You have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

You suspect he would not have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark, barren realm, you raise your concerns with Randolph. “It is true that we are farther from your companions than we intended, he affirms. “However, if I may offer another sentiment—perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Clearly the Underworld has something to do with the creatures invading our reality. I suggest we investigate further while we have the chance. We can return to the surface of the Dreamlands once we have discovered the truth.”\nYou ask Randolph if he has any leads, and he steps to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. “I have been here before,” he says quietly, getting his bearings. “Those walls in the distance belong to the City of Gugs. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below. That plain is where the ghouls live. Perhaps there we can learn more.” You raise your doubts aloud, wondering if such creatures are even capable of peaceful conversation. “They are more intelligent than you think, and could be quite helpful if we convince them to aid us. In fact, there is one I count among my friends, an artist by the name of Richard Pickman. If we are fortunate enough to find him, that might be our best chance.” You still have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

Someone or something is causing it, but how? Just as you are pondering its meaning, you realize something curious: you aren’t the only one affected. Far from it, in fact; the entirety of the Underworld seems to be changing with each wave of warped energy that flows through the realm. Walls shift, the floor skews, and the dim, phosphorescent light scintillates with a cosmic, otherworldly glow. The ground rumbles as another wave of force rushes through the foundations of the dream world. The rocky surface upon which you stand gives way. You flail in the air, attempting to grab hold of something, anything that you can use to pull yourself up. Your hands wrap around a painted plank of wood. You have no time to question its appearance—survival comes first.\nWhen you pull yourself up, you realize you are curled up on a park bench, surrounded by a thick fog and the grim, gambrel rooftops of Arkham. There is no ground in front of you. Just an open, endless pit into fathomless depths. The Underworld, perhaps? But how is that possible? Virgil’s cat watches you casually from a tree branch that hangs over the park bench. “It won’t stop,” the black cat tells you. “Not until there is nothing left of your world.” You wonder what you could possibly do in the face of such horror. The cat gazes down into the pit below. “It’s waiting for you.”\nAnother rumble. In the distance, you watch with horror as an entire building is sucked into the ground. You think you spot a pedestrian in the distance, but it is no human. If this goes on any longer, your companions won’t have a world to awaken to. You steel yourself, look down into the empty pit, and gulp. “Down you go,” the cat says.\nYou fall. The roar of the wind is deafening as it whips by your head. You can’t possibly survive a fall like this, you think. But instead of splattering against a hard, rocky ground, you are caught by a glowing, sinewy web. Panicking, you scramble to a nearby platform made of solid rock. Your refuge is one of many, each suspended in the air and connected by thick webbing.

      "text": "<fancy>Friday, February 13th, 1925</fancy>\nSomething odd was happening in Arkham, Massachusetts.\nTypically, this would not be a surprise to the residents of the dreary New England town. Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance, however, was anything but typical.\nIt all began in the latest issue of <i>Tales from Nevermore</i>. A writer by the name of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the moon, and a curious talking cat…among other things equally difficult to believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention. Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, <i>Tales from Nevermore</i> began to receive and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the ears of experts.\nVirgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently, experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?\nYou and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong…"

      "text": "It has been more than twenty-four hours since your companions fell asleep. Over the course of the past day, your curiosity has slowly turned to concern and then dread. The problems began when one of your friends started to toss and turn violently in their sleep. You snapped to attention and tried to shake them awake, but it was to no avail. You tried everything. Physical contact was no use, and water did nothing but soak their clothes and bed fruitlessly. Even opening their eyelids did not wake them, and in the process, you noticed that their pupils had fully dilated and their eyes were glazed over with a milky-white fog.\nYou have no idea what this could mean for your friends. Have they managed to find their way to the land Virgil Gray described in his writings? Or has something more sinister taken root within their minds and bodies? Just to be safe, you decide to take your companions to St. Mary’s Hospital. If something ails them physically, perhaps the doctors there can discern what is wrong. Otherwise, you will simply have to watch over them and hope that they return safely to the waking world.\nSt. Mary’s is the only hospital in the town of Arkham, and it is a fixture of its Uptown neighborhood. You explain the situation to Nurse Greenberg, the head nurse at the hospital, who instructs several other nurses to carry your companions into the emergency ward on stretchers. She tells you with a warm, friendly smile that your friends will be examined by Doctor Maheswaran, but other than that, you are left entirely in the dark.\nHours pass. You hear nothing about the status of your companions. You still have not met with Doctor Maheswaran, and you’re starting to grow impatient. You feel something crawling along your arm, and you instinctively brush it away, then wonder if it was an insect or a figment of your imagination. You begin to question whether bringing your friends here was the right choice after all. Eventually, you decide to take matters into your own hands.\nIt is late at night, and the receptionist who instructed you to stay in the waiting room is nowhere to be seen. In fact, there are eerily few people roaming the halls of the hospital. With nobody to stop you, you sneak off into the emergency ward to find your friends. It does not take long for you to find their room. Your companions lie asleep on clean, white cots, their sleep anything but peaceful. They are pale faced and sweaty. One of them tosses and turns in their sleep, their brow furrowed with pain or worry.\nDoctor Maheswaran does not seem surprised by your intrusion. “Shivani Maheswaran,” she introduces herself coldly, without looking up from her clipboard. “You’re the ones who brought them in, right? Before you ask: no, I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life,” she says with a hint of dry impatience. You demand that she tell you everything she knows about their condition and not give you the runaround. With a sigh, she puts her clipboard down and addresses you frankly. “Listen, I may be new to Arkham, but I have seen enough inexplicable maladies in this town to fill entire careers in medicine. I understand why you are concerned. Your friends…” She struggles to find the right words. “They are not simply asleep. It is as if they are hovering somewhere between sleep and unconsciousness, or even death. They are not aware of anything happening around them but appear to be reacting to some kind of internal stimuli.”\nWithout hesitation, you ask if they are dreaming. “Dreaming?” Doctor Maheswaran replies. “It is unlikely, though it might account for their mannerisms. Honestly—and I know this is not exactly reassuring— none of this makes any sense to me, medically speaking.”\nJust then, you see a large, hairy spider crawling on the chest of one of your friends. “Well, that is odd.” Doctor Maheswaran brushes the spider off, and several more emerge from the sheets to take its place. You and the doctor both take several steps back out of pure instinct. You hear heavy footsteps in the hallway outside the emergency ward, and then the lights begin to flicker. “Okay…that is more than simply odd. What in the world is going on out there?” Doctor Maheswaran asks anxiously.\nFor just a moment, you think you hear one of your sleeping companions whisper something. Are they indeed dreaming? And if so, what does their condition have to do with these strange events?"

Hideous monsters begin to close in around you, and you envision yourself wrapped in webs, waiting to be a spider’s meal. Eventually you come to a dead end: a room covered from floor to ceiling in thick, sticky webs. The skittering of spider legs follows close behind, and you realize you have no hope to escape unless there is a path behind the webs. There is no choice remaining for you. You run headlong into the webs, ripping and tearing at them with the ferocity of a cornered animal. It is tough work, but eventually you see a light behind the webs—perhaps an escape route.\nOnce you cross through the webs, you are no longer in the dark, sterile halls of St. Mary’s, but in a narrow, web-covered cavern. You dare not tarry or go back the way you came, so you run through the dark, cramped cave with no idea where it might lead. Glancing through the cobwebs to your left and right, you see not just hard rock, but the glimmering of lights, like a sea of stars looming beyond the silken threads. Eventually, you emerge from another wall of webs, only to find yourself in an alleyway in Arkham’s Merchant District, near the Miskatonic River. You have neither the time nor the desire to analyze this, instead deciding to put as much distance as you can between you and the hospital.

Randolph ponders this for a moment, then replies: “Normally, dreamers can return to the real world simply by willing themselves awake, but for some reason, your friends are unable to do so. If you truly wish to help them, you too must enter the Dreamlands and find them. But forcing your way into the Dreamlands is not easy. Such paths are usually accessible only to experienced dreamers, and only in sleep. Still, there are some places where the Dreamlands touch the waking world, and in those places, with the right tools, you may enter the Dreamlands in your physical body. I know of such a place, not far from here. However—”\nBefore Randolph is able to finish his sentence, he is interrupted by a mysterious voice…",

As the awful creatures weave each thread, you feel reality and dreams distort, collide, and crash together. In the distance, waves of dream break upon the rocks of reality, and reality collapses upon itself into the surging, amorphous dream. You can barely comprehend the strange, shifting vistas. A sticky web hangs off the side of your vantage point, like a silken ladder leading down to your doom."

You will complete the errand upon which I have sent you, regardless. Your world depends on it.\"\nBewildered, you ask why Randolph is acting this way. The black cat jumps onto your shoulder and perches there, its gaze never leaving your erstwhile companion. \"I figured it out a little while ago. He's not Randolph. He never was. Just an interloper in Randolph's skin.\"\n\"Interloper?\" Randolph thunders with anger. \"You, cat, are the interloper! Yes, I know what you are. This is not your place. But enough talk.\" A smile crawls along his lips once more. \"You have a task to perform. Goodbye, then… for now.\" With his warning complete, Not-Randolph walks off of the edge of the platform and falls into oblivion."

You look to Randolph to make sure he is okay, and it is then that you notice he is not climbing above you as you had suspected he would. You look up to find your companion scowling at you from above, a blade of onyx in his hands. He has cut a segment of the web upon which you are climbing. You plummet to the rocks below, landing painfully on your back. When you look back up at Randolph, his countenance has changed.\n\"Foolish mortals. I was never going to allow you to save your companions. You have an errand of mine to run, and that is your sole purpose. If you wish to live, complete this task for me.\" He peers across at the unfathomble spider that looms before you. \"I shall be the one to claim your world—not that thing.\" Then, Not-Randolph simply turns and walks away."

When you reach the top, your heart sinks. There is no sign of Arkham here. You are greeted instead by a strange, ruined city and its half-human denizens. The creatures inform you that you have reached the lost city of \"Sarkomand.\" It appears your return journey is far from over.",

How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\nAlejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private.

I have no doubt Alejandro will uncover the answers to these questions, given enough time.\nAs for me, my role in this endeavor has ended. However, I have yet to relax. My thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths. When I walk through the streets, I find myself drawn toward the museum without realizing it, as though possessed to see the relic once again.

When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet…I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures they encountered…” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for all of us. Read this journal, and if you can, please keep an eye on my colleague.” You agree to help, but his worry does not fade. “I only hope that I am not damning you to a similar fate by asking for your aid.”\nYou spend the remainder of that night studying the expedition journal, your mind swimming with thoughts of strange serpent-creatures and Aztec warriors.

But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\nWe ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple.

Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\nJosé was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\nWith the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\nMaria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City.

Securing enough food and supplies for the journey is a constant struggle, and you are harrassed at every turn by the jungle’s inhabitants. Fortunately, you have seen no sign yet of the serpent people who attacked the previous expedition, but you’re positive they are out there. Watching. Waiting.\nOn the morning of the sixth day, you find the entrance. It is a huge cave opening, partially obscured by trees, brush, and vines. You nearly missed the great cavern maw altogether, despite its enormity. Surrounding the cavern’s entrance are six stone pillars, each covered in strange grooves and carvings that glow with a dim red hue. Perhaps one of your guides will understand what this means?"

He’d said he had a job offer for me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect.\nHarlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers.\nAlejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this— or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along.\nThe way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer. Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."

Perhaps I would rather these events had been a figment of my imagination.\nIn truth, I have no idea how we made it out of the caverns beneath the jungle alive. Simply reaching the abyssal place was a hellish ordeal. My memory of our return trip is muddled and disarrayed. We scrambled in the dark for what seemed like ages. We were out of food, out of supplies, out of hope—but somehow, we found a way out.\nOur reward for preventing calamity was scorn and ridicule. No upstanding paper or university would publish our findings, and of course we possessed no proof of our expedition save for our scars and nightmares. I wish I could say that my memory of these events has faded with each passing day, but I will never forget the alien city we explored in our conical bodies, the serpents that pursued us in red-litten Yoth, the formless abomination that lived in the depths of the Earth…\nPerhaps that is why I fear making a written account of our findings—because these memories will crystallize and become etched in my mind, forever damning me to a life of terror and dismay. Still, the world needs to know what we saw. What we did.",

The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\nIchtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\nCrossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\nPadma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs.\nOnce she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation…"

The glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples. Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air.\nRising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\nYour head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back. I know where to find the Nexus, and you must journey with me.”",

Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of the past few hours. “You saw it, did you not? The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\nIt is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing…Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her.

They are horrifying to look upon, but they do not harm you as you expected they might. Your first few days are spent restrained and questioned by the creatures, several of which are somehow able to communicate in English. Others reproduce your language using an odd futuristic machine, played like a musical instrument. You are reminded strangely of the jazz piano at the Nightingale. It is only then that you realize your body has been altered. You have no hands or fingers to play the keys, no legs to walk upon, no lungs to scream out. You are one of them now, one of the creatures that has taken you captive, and your original body is nowhere to be seen.\nDespite your captivity, the creatures do not seem intent on harming you. Instead, they merely interview you, asking all manner of questions about a broad range of topics: your society, your profession, your technology, your ecosystem, your human body. Their thirst for knowledge is unyielding, unending. Their questions range from the mundane to the complex. They implore you to write copiously in your own language, taking anything you write to store away in their vast archives. You are informed that you will be able to roam the city freely if you comply."

You struggle so hard against your restraints that they pierce into your leathery, cold flesh, drawing out a bit of viscous slime-blood. Your guard quickly apporoaches, clicking its claws together repeatedly. It undoes your restraints, and the moment it does, your claw appendages strike at what you believe to be the creature’s throat.

You push the nurse away and rise to your feet, suddenly puzzled and disoriented. Despite the nurse’s protests, you wobble feebly out of the room. You are in a hospital, its white halls smelling faintly of disinfectant and other chemicals. Just moments prior, hadn’t you been exploring some kind of underground cavern?… You cannot recall.\n“Excuse me? Come back, you must rest!” The nurse calls out to you, gripping your forearm and pulling you back to your cot. She examines you closely while you recover from the shock of being transported so far in so short a time. “Who is Alejandro?” she asks, and you struggle to recall. The name doesn’t ring a bell.\nYou ask the nurse how you came to be here, wondering why she isn’t surprised at your sudden appearance. “Why, you admitted yourself to St. Mary’s just last night. Do you not remember?” You have no memory of this, and you are starting to grow concerned. “You were acting a little strangely, if I may be so bold. And you spoke in a strange fashion, almost as if English weren’t your first language. But now I see that you probably just drank a little bit too much.” She notices your questioning expression and smiles. “Don’t worry. We get that kind of thing quite often these days, now that all the bars and pubs are on the up-and-up again.”\nYou examine your face in the mirror. You are tired and older than you remember. Something important lies on the very edge of your memory, fuzzy and blurred. It takes about a minute before the significance of the nurse’s last statement catches up to you. Turning back toward the nurse, you ask what year it is, terrified of the answer.\n“Why, 1934 of course. My, you must have had a heck of a night!” She chuckles.",

You grope around in the darkness until you feel the jagged wall of the cavern and begin to follow it aimlessly, desperately hoping to find the way forward. A grim realization dawns on you: Even should you complete your task, you will surely never find a way back to the surface. The overwhelming darkness of the cavern fills you with a dread you have never before experienced. You cannot see your hands as you grope about in the darkness, nor can you tell if you are in a narrow tunnel or a vast open space. The ground beside you could extend for miles or abruptly become a bottomless cavern, and you would not be able to tell the difference unless you stepped there. Hours pass as you stumble in the dark, slowly, carefully, nervously. Every step could be your last."

The technology behind the device’s design is far beyond what any human could accomplish, but quite possible for the Yithians. You even recognize some elements of the relic’s construction from the technology in Pnakotus. Somehow, it ended up in the hands of the Eztli, who defended it with care from all manner of creatures. Creatures that predate humanity. Creatures who wished to use it to turn back time. And now that the relic is in your possession, only you can stop this from occurring."

You are intruders in their home, and they know these hellish tunnels better than you. With your wounds slowing you down and panic seeping into every one of your decisions, your death at the hands of these creatures is inevitable. Despair worms its way into your mind. When the serpents inevitably catch up to you, you are crossing one of the cavern’s many long bridges of stone that span a wide, dark chasm. Serpent creatures on both sides of the chasm flank you, spear tips corralling you against the precarious edge of the bridge. A small hunk of stone cracks at your heel and detaches, falling into the inky void below. You do not hear it strike the floor of the chasm. There is no hope to escape or flee this time—you have no choice but to accept your fate. The spear tips press you closer to the edge. You close your eyes and fall.",

They are here!—” The line goes dead.\nSure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time. Find the relic and meet me back here tonight. <i>Don’t</i> follow me.”"

After all, these are not my memories, but the memories of my other self: the self who ventured through time and space to save humanity.\nIt is difficult to explain how we did what we did. After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember.

We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.\nThe dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.\nAlready one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds."

The ship sways back and forth as angry waves thrash against its hull. \"'Fraid it's gon' be a bit rocky,\" the ship captain shouts over the crashing of the tumultuous sea. \"Weather's been awful wild of late. Strange tides an' stranger winds.\"\nBut still you stare up at the ominous lighthouse, its beacon a guiding light, a warning sign, or both. Curious what knowledge he might have, you ask Mr. Moore about the lighthouse. \"That ol' thing? Been there longer'n Innsmouth itself. Marsh family's kept it runnin' as long as I remember. Oceiros is keeper now. Strange fella, that Oceiros. They say the only place in town he visits is the Order o' Dagon hall by New Church Green.\" He shakes his head.\nYou wonder if there are more secrets inside the lighthouse than meets the eye. Mr. Moore seems to note your curiosity. \"I've heard them Marshes've carved out caverns beneath the lighthouse goin' all the way down to sea level an' beyond,\" he claims. \"Dunno if that's true, but sometimes when I'm out at sea I've seen groups of 'em up by the cliffside, all wavin' an kneelin' like they're prayin' or something. Never really paid it much mind, but…\" his voice grows quieter. \"Jus' thought you oughta know.\"\nYou nod and thank him. If what he's saying is true, perhaps you should give this lighthouse a visit. You make a mental note to research more about Falcon Point once you return to town.\nWhen your mind snaps back to the present, you recall the legwork you'd done after your expedition to Devil Reef, and the information you found on the vast network of tunnels beneath the lighthouse…"

So much the better—you'd prefer to keep your investigation quiet.\nYou jot down notes as the drunken man rambles on about the creatures he's seen swimming off the coast and prowling around the reefs. \"Deep Ones,\" he names them. \"Caught one in my net once,\" he blabbers through slurred speach. \"She an' her eggs—tha's right!—'er eggs, bigger'n your fist, an' squirmin' an' wrigglin', too!\"\nAbsorbed in the ritual of telling a tale for his fellow sailors, he elaborates: \"She had one of 'em in her arms. Tiny little devil, with bulgin', hateful eyes. Couldn't stand the sight of it. I threw the net o'er as soon as I realized what I'd caught, an' came right back 'ere. If I had my way I'd never sail 'gain.\"\nYou mull this new information over in your head. If this man speaks the truth, these creatures seem to have a lifecycle similar to that of a fish. But then, what is the purpose of the uncanny hybrid creatures you have seen skulking about the town? Are they but figments of your frightened imagination? Or is there a much more sinister part of this lifecycle that you are missing?"

The coves and tidal caverns of Devil Reef were home not just to relics of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, but also to a horde of strange creatures: hybrids between fish, man, and monster. You might have escaped with your life, but the horrors you saw in those caves will stay with you forever.

A plan to enter the realm of the Deep Ones and end their conspiracy once and for all. \"This is ridiculous, you know that, right?\" Harper asks. You nod. Of course it's ridiculous. You've spent the last two days on the run. Chased. Hunted. Tormented.\nBut you've also spend the last two days recovering the memories you've forgotten. And what you've seen is something you can't possibly ignore. You have seen the deity the Esoteric Order of Dagon is named for, and you understand what the Order plans to do. The alignment of the celestial bodies in the sky, the steadily rising tides, the tumultuous fluctuating weather, the creatures emerging from the deep, all of it is tied together. You have seen it. There will come a flood, a great disaster to wipe out humanity, so only the deep remains. The great city in the reef shall rise once more and become the beating heart of all life on Earth.\nThere are still gaps in your memory, but all this you know to be true. All of Innsmouthis consumed by this conspiracy. The Order controlled the town through its oaths and the secret wealth it hoarded from the deep. It was no wonder they treated outsiders like yourself with such scorn.\nYou give Harper a knowing glare. She sighs and nods. \"I know. It's the only way.\" Together, the two of you plot your course. Abandoned ships still litter the harbor of Innsmouth. Under the cover of night, you must commandeer one of them, sail to Devil Reef, and descend once more into the antediluvian ruins in the depths below the forsaken islands. That is where the other entrance to the city lies. Y'ha-nthlei.\nYour skin prickles with cold shivers as you utter the word aloud.

The sun and moon align over the distant horizon, threatening a grim, uncertain future.\nYou remember the layout of the town and several strange faces you met during your first few days there, but nothing that transpired between then and waking up in that waterlogged pit. Agent Harper has been trying to fill you in, but with so many gaps in your memory, each explanation only perplexes you further.\n\"Ever since you came to Innsmouth, things have only gotten worse. It began with the locals. Each day, they got rowdier and more hostile, especially to outsiders like you and me. Do you remember how nauseating some of them looked? Slimy, grayish skin? Wide lips, bulging eyes, that sort of thing?\"\nYou nod. Now that you've remembered, you almost wish you hadn't. It wasn't just the way they looked, either. Their hoarse voices croaked syllables barely resembling human speech, and they reeked of rotting fish.\n\"They're the ones who've been stirring up trouble recently. And that's not all. There are other creatures skulking around Innsmouth of late. I'm sure you've seen them, too.\" She shudders. \"There's some kind of connection between the Esoteric Order of Dagon and those… things. Not sure what yet, but we'll get to the bottom of it if—\"\nAgent Harper's voice trails off as she climbs to the top of the headland. Whatever has her staring agape can't be good. You reach the top, haul yourself over the ridge, and see the same devastation she does.\nInnsmouth has been invaded. The same creatures you encountered in that sacrificial pit prowl the street—foul things from the depths of the sea, or perhaps beyond. They patrol the alleys and intersections, searching for something. Hunting. Makeshift barricades block the various pathways through the town as water from the Manuxet River spills out onto the streets.\n\"No, this can't be…\" Agent Harper intones. A moment of silent gloom hangs between you. It is clear that Innsmouth is no longer safe. You inform Agent Harper that Agent Dawson left his vehicle near hers, at the abandoned railway station on the western edge of Innsmouth. She nods, understanding. \"Right. We have to get to the other side of town, and fast.\"\nThe sky above you is bathed in hues of violent crimson. With any luck, no more of that color will be spilled today."

You sneak between the dark, dusty shelves as you search for anything you can find about the Esoteric Order of Dagon.\nThe shop is quiet, and your tail hasn't followed you here. You spend some time perusing the dark, narrow rows of shelves, until you come to a basement with a chain-locked door. There's no way you're getting that door open, but the answers you seek must lay beyond. Somehow, you have to get in there. Just then, the beam of a flashlight shines through the front window of the shop. Your tail is on to you. You flee out the back door, hoping to return another time…\n… and the vision ends. You are back in the present, standing in what remains of the bookshop. Flood waters have destroyed the shelving and rendered most of the books unreadable. However, from the corner of your eye, you notice the once-locked basement door is now ajar. You rush down the steps, splashing through water up to your knees. What you find is an assortment of scrolls and tomes, many in a runic, alien, yet strangely familiar language. Whatever this trove of knowledge is, it must pertain to the Esoteric Order of Dagon.

In the City of the Deep Ones!\" Her gaze seems to drill into the back of your skull.\nYou take her hand and politely detach it from your arm. It would appear you can't even walk down the street in this town without being accosted by some crackpot—and yet, something about the grievous look in her milky eyes gives you pause. Whatever this woman speaks of, she believes it with absolute certainty. Sighing, you ask her what she is talking about.\n\"Th-they are on their way,\" she sputters. \"First, the alignment. Then the tide. Then the progeny of Mother Hydra.\" Her pale, blind eyes search for yours. Still, her absurd babbling is of no use to you. You are about to depart when she probes for your hand and presses something into your palm. \"Take it!\" she says. You hand it back to her and brush her off. You want no part of this foolishness; your task is to find Agent Harper, not collect bizarre knickknacks. Her expression sours as you turn to leave.\nWhen you return to the present, you are standing over the woman's shredded corpse. Whatever \"nonsense\" she was spouting was in fact a genuine warning. Clutched in her stiff hand is the strange gold coin she'd offered you weeks before. This time, you take it with you."

Given the way the townsfolk have impeded your investigation at every turn, it almost seems like the entire town is against you.\nYou round the corner and come face-to-face with the kidnapper's erstwhile jail cell. Not only is it empty, but its bars are bent outward from the middle—enough to fit a human through, or perhaps something even larger.

If the tide is rising this quickly here, it could be happening along the eastern seaboard. Arkham, Boston, no city is safe. Worse yet, nobody would believe such a tall tale until it was too late.\nWhatever these creatures are, they are scheming something that could put the entire world in jeopardy. You cannot allow that to happen.\n\"I don't suppose you have Dawson's key, do you?\" Harper asks. You can't imagine you would, yet when you check your belongings, you find a polished silver key among them. Dawson must have given it to you before his untimely end. You try the key on the driver's side door of his automobile, and it turns with an audible click. \"Well, would you look at that.\"\nEager to be away, she starts her car. At the engine's shuddering ignition, your mind reels with sudden pain. A bright spot, like the incandescent sun, flares within your sight. \"Okay, so… where to now?\" she asks, but you're barely able to register her words. The blinding flare grows larger and brighter. The rumbling of the engine drowns out all other sound. The world spins. You fall to the ground, clutching your temples. Your entire head is on fire. You can hear Harper calling to you, but her voice is muffled, like she is deep underwater. Or perhaps you are.\nYour vision fades.

But worst of all, the entity the cult worships-Dagon-is just one of two. His mate, Hydra, still slumbers in the depths below Innsmouth, waiting to awaken and stake her claim over an endless ocean.\nThese are the conclusions that have led to your plan: Travel once more to Devil Reef, descend into the city of the Deep Ones that lies hidden at the bottom of the ocean, and put a stop to the Deep Ones' plans once and for all.

      "text": "You are deep below the Esoteric Order of Dagon's headquarters once more, emerging from the hall where you had disrupted the Order's ritual. You follow Agent Dawson through a series of winding, flooded corridors flanked by statues of aquatic monstrosities and malformed beasts. You ask Dawson where exactly you're headed, but he doesn't reply. Finally, you enter another chamber, similar to the last. Its walls are covered in otherworldly effigies and a depiction of ocean waves swirling below an alignment of celestial bodies. Another familiar pool dominates the cavern, inside which the dark shape of something massive slumbers. To your surprise, Agent Harper stands in front of the pool, gazing into its dark reflection. She turns with a start when she hears you approach, relaxing only once she sees who you are. \"Is it done?\" Dawson asks.\nShe nods. \"This one isn't waking up anytime soon.\"\n\"Good. The Order is on to us. We have no time to spare. Let's get to the vault and take what we came for.\"\nYou reel. What exactly is going on here? Both of the agents notice your confusion at the same time. A moment of grim understanding dawns as you realize the truth of the situation. The agency didn't come here to investigate criminal activity in Innsmouth at all. They came here for something else. And the only vaults you've seen so far in these depths are the ones filled with archaic riches. The material wealth that has kept the town of Innsmouth afloat all these years-perhaps the very riches that persuaded so many townsfolk to follow the Order and forsake their own humanity.\nStifling your frustration, you ask how much of Dawson's briefing was a lie. \"Not all of it,\" he says calmly. \"Agent Harper was missing when I contacted you, that much was true. But she was sent here on a different mission. One we must complete this very moment or risk losing everything we've worked for. And you're going to help us.\"\nYou cross your arms in defiance. It's one thing to be kept in the dark by the two agents you've risked your life for. It's another to help them smuggle treasure on behalf of the government, especially when so much more is at stake.\n\"I don't think you understand,\" Dawson replies, his voice surprisingly level. \"You are an asset of the agency and under my authority. You will do as I command.\" As the silence between you grows more and more tense, you spot Dawson's hand twitching toward his holstered weapon. Is he truly willing to go that far…?\nJust then, you hear shouting down the hall. \"Shit. They're here.\" Dawson turns to Harper, his orders terse and quiet: \"Take the exit through Devil Reef. We'll head back the way we came. Meet up at the vault.\"\nThe next minute is a blur. Dawson and Harper split up. Despite your anger, you decide it is best to follow Agent Dawson, since you are familiar with the escape route. A torrent of footsteps and hollers follows close behind. You don't get far before you are cornered. An elderly man with wide, unblinking eyes and long robes blocks your exit. \"Take them,\" he says. The rest you recall only in flashes of horror. The interrogation. The dark, flooded pit. Dawson's fate. Harper discovering you on the beach-\n-You turn on Harper, your vision adjusting back to the present. She seems to understand what you have seen. Her hand hovers dangerously near her handgun. \"Dammit,\" she says. \"I was hoping you wouldn't remember what happened the last time we were in this room…\" She draws in a shaky breath as the two of you silently judge one another. \"So, what now?\" she asks. \"I still have a job to do. Are you going to get in my way?\""

All of the evidence has lead you here. Whatever is going on in this town, this Order is behind it. You're sure of it… though their ultimate goal remains a mystery.\nThe town is eerily quiet as you stand before the building's entrance. Once, this place might have been impressive and opulent. Years of disrepair and flood damage have reduced it to a near-ruin. Its once-white paint is gray and peeling, and many of the pillars outside the entryway are beginning to crumble. Still, it is one of the more intimidating places in Innsmouth, projecting authority despite its decrepitude. No, not authority—something darker. A looming, unspoken threat.\n\"Are you ready?\" Agent Dawson asks. His usually calm demeanor has vanished, replaced with a humorless gravity that throws you off guard. \"This is it. This is where we'll find answers.\"\nYou're not so sure. Every other lead you've followed has led to only more questions."

Who sent you here?\" a voice asks. It is deep and husky, like the croaking of a frog.\nYou hear the familiar, cool baritone of Agent Dawson reply: \"Your breath smells awful. Ever heard of brushing your teeth?\" Despite the sarcasm dripping from his words, his voice wavers ever so slightly.\n\"Your mockery only masks the fear that hides within,\" the voice replies. \"Very well. If you are of no use to us, you will be the first to be sacrificed.\"\nYour vision continues to adjust. You can just barely make out Dawson's silhouette on the other side of the cell. He is kneeling before a metal hatch in the stone floor. An elderly robed figure presses a curved knife against Dawson's throat. Someone lifts the hatch, and Dawson's eyes go wide. He gives you one last despairing look, shakes his head slowly and deliberately, and quietly slides something across the stone floor. Then the hooded figure pushes him in. In the scuffle and the low light, nobody notices the car key that skitters to a halt directly next to you.\nYou grab the key and stuff it into your pocket just before you are shoved forward. Two more sets of cold, clammy hands grasp your shoulders, and the hooded figure slides his knife up to your neck. All you can see of his face are his wide, unblinking eyes.\n\"Oceiros, these ones were found in Dagon's lair as well,\" another voice explains to the elderly figure in the robes. \"We believe they were the ones snooping around Devil Reef.\"\nThe man with the knife to your throat nods. \"Your turn,\" he declares. \"Tell us why you have come and perhaps we will let you go.

You lie on a jagged stone floor in a shallow pool of dark, ice-cold water. Knowing panic will only make the situation worse, you take a series of deep, meditative breaths. you try to remember something—anything—that might allow you to retrace your steps, but your mind is blank. You remember who you are, but nothing whatsoever from the recent past. You steady yourself and examine your surroundings.\nThe chamber appears to be a natural cave formation. Kelp dangles from the ceiling. The stone walls and floor are wet and slimy. A rhythmic drip, drip, drip echoes throughout the otherwise silent cave. This cavern has been underwater, and not too long ago. A result of the tides, perhaps? You swallow your fear like a lump of cold iron. If it is low tide now… A cold shudder ripples up your spine. You examine the ceiling and are surprised to see a slab of metal set into the rough stone overhead. Its polished surface is alien to the rest of the natural cavern. You call out for help, hoping somebody can hear.\nYour dread deepens at the reply: an awful croaking and gurgling that permeates the tunnels—a sound no human could make."

      "text": "You stand in a small office, examining a worn photograph in a well-polished wooden frame. In the photo, a squad of men in military uniforms pose in front of a Bristol F.2 Fighter plane. Several of the men wear tan British uniforms, but one sports the olive overcoat and khakis of an American soldier. His sleeves each bear a rectangular patch striped vertically with a captain's paired silver bars. At the bottom of the photograph, in black ink, cursive handwriting reads \"British Fourth Army, outside St. Quentin, 1918.\"\nThe door to the office opens suddenly, startling you. You put the photograph down and turn to address the man entering. You identify him immediately by his dark-brown skin, his strong jaw, and his broad shoulders. It is Thomas Dawson—the American from the photograph—though he has aged a bit since his war days, and heavy bags hang under his eyes. \"One war ends; a new one begins,\" he says quietly. \"Only this enemy is even harder to root out.\"\nYou ask the man what a war hero is doing in the investigative business, and he chuckles softly in response. \"War hero? I don't know where you heard that from. I was just doing my duty.\" You shake your head but do not argue further. You suspect that the squadron Captain Dawson rescued would disagree as well.\n\"In any event, I suppose you're wondering why I summoned you here to Boston,\" he says, gesturing for you to take a seat in front of his desk. You sit and respond to his remark with affirmation, wondering aloud why a telephone call would not have sufficed. \"This is a… sensitive matter,\" he replies. \"A few days ago, I lost contact with one of my agents, a Miss Elina Harper. I had her investigating several strange reports I've received in the past few months, all concerning a town called Innsmouth. Do you know the place? It's along the coast to the north of your town of Arkham, just by Ipswich.\"\nYou know the place. Though most have never heard of the shadowed, decrepit seaport, those who do hear only ill rumors. From what you understand, the town used to be lively port before the War of 1812, but it has since become dingy and run-down. The only railway line that runs through Innsmouth is abandoned, and there are no references to the town on any maps or in any guidebooks you have ever seen.\n\"Perhaps she's found something curious or has gone into hiding, but I suspect foul play. It could be mob work, but I doubt it. I'm not sending any more agents until I know for sure. However, I have some room in our discretionary budget to hire a third party, such as yourself.\" You assume Agent Dawson is dancing around the truth, which is that you are expendable. \"I know it isn't much to go on, but I need to know the status of Agent Harper. Even bad news would be better than no news, at this point. If you do me this favor, our agency will be in your debt.\" You ask which agency Dawson is referring to. A smirk tugs at his lips.\nWhen you snap back to the present, you still gaze at Agent Dawson's face, only his smirk is twisted in a haunting visage of agony. It is just one of the many faces that writhe in torment throughout this repulsive creature's scaly, pulsating flesh."

Yeah, that was me. Sorry I couldn't stick around and chat, but I had some other business to attend to,\" she explains. She tells you that after several days in captivity, she finally managed to get the upper hand against her captor and free herself, but she was injured in the process.

      "text": "<center><game>WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 17, 1927</game></center>\n<center><game>FIVE WEEKS EARLIER</game></center>\n\"Wake up, dammit!\" Agent Dawson shakes you awake with his right hand. You are in the passenger seat of a pristine, state-of-the-art motorcar, its polished body glowing with light from the moon as it rolls through the foggy Massachusetts countryside. \"We're almost there,\" Dawson informs you. Unfortunately, Innsmouth lacks a working railroad, which you would have preferred. There is a bus that runs from Boston to Newburyport and another that runs from Newburyport to Innsmouth… but Dawson had insisted on driving you there himself, perhaps to provide you an escape route should things go sour, or to show off his expensive automobile. Probably both.\nAs you arrive in Innsmouth, the stale odor of day-old fish and decrepit, musty buildings washes over you. Many of the buildings along the western side of the town seem to be abandoned, though you occasionally spot figures in some of the windows. You imagine Agent Dawson's opulent car must make quite an impression in such a dirty and dingy town. You joke that perhaps he should have driven here in a jalopy, to which he replies with a smirk: \"That's never been my style.\"\nEventually, you reach a defunct railroad station that was given up years ago. A few train cars sit abandoned on the tracks, and the depot is boarded up and condemned. Dawson suddenly grimaces and points to another vehicle in the open lot. \"That's Agent Harper's breezer. Let's park here and continue on foot. We can move through the town a little easier that way,\" he reasons.\nYou check Agent Harper's vehicle before continuing, but it contains no clues as to her whereabouts. From there, you head eastward beside the Manuxet River, passing numerous deserted warehouses, sodden alleyways, and standoffish townsfolk. \"Harper's got to be somewhere in this forsaken town. Residents don't look all too friendly. Wouldn't be surprised if she drew too much attention from a local mob or the like…\" Dawson begins to contemplate aloud. You ask how he knows his agent isn't simply keeping a low profile. \"Ah yes—well, we have a code phrase for that. If she had sent me a letter saying she 'had some errands to run,' that would have signalled that she would be out of touch for a short while. Without that signal, I have to assume the worst.\" To the northeast, several factory buildings loom over the rest of the town's sagging gambrel roofs, cupolas, and widow's walks. None of the locals stop to greet you along your way. Given the repulsive countenance that many of them bear, their aversion to the usual small-town pleasantries is a relief.\nEventually, you reach the town square just south of Manuxet, though even these crumbling brick buildings that surround the supposed heart of the town inspire little confidence in Agent Harper's safety. An old bus idles nearby, its greasy-looking driver leaning against the door and eyeing you suspiciously. With little else to go on, you decide to split up, knowing that you can cover much more ground that way. \"Canvass the locals and learn more about this town,\" Dawson says. \"Find out who the big shots are in this hellhole. One of them is bound to know where Harper was last seen, or who she was with. I'm going to see if I can find where she was hiding out and look for some sign of her. Meet up with me here at 1900 hours. Understood?\" You nod in agreement and go your separate ways.\nThe first person you check with is the bus driver, who probably has a decent understanding of the town. His coarse, greyish skin is the first thing you notice, followed swiftly by unusually deep and shadowed creases in the flesh of his neck, almost as if he were prematurely aged. His bulging eyes are unsettling, and you're suddenly unsure whether you've seen him blink even once as you approach. You start to offer your hand as you introduce yourself, then think better of it, just in case the man has some kind of disease you've never heard of. He introduces himself as Joe Sargent and gives you a useful—if cursory—rundown of some of the nearby buildings."

The more time you spend in this strange, squalid town, the more you wish you had never taken Agent Dawson up on his offer. There is something foul in the air here, something rotten and fetid that disturbs you to your core.\nLater that night, you meet up with Agent Dawson in the now-deserted town square and share what you have learned. \"Take a look at this,\" he says, handing you a creased, ink-stained letter addressed to him. \"Turns out Harper had a room at that disgusting old hotel. Still does, technically, but it seemed like she hadn't been around for a few days. I broke in and found this among her things.\"\nJudging from the unmailed letter, it seems Agent Harper knew something in town was tracking her movements. <i>I'm being followed</i>, the missive explains. <i>Don't know how they know, but they know. It's like the whole town is in on something. I have no contacts here whom I trust. I'm going to require more than one agent to sort this out, I fear--</i>\nThe letter is cut short. \"Well, she has more than one agent now,\" Dawson says bitterly once you are done reading. \"There's only one reason she wouldn't have sent this letter. Harper's in danger, and somebody in this balled-up town knows where she is.\" Together, you begin to formulate a plan to find Agent Harper. First, narrow down her last known location. Second, find out who knew she was in town. Then… pay them a visit."

Your heart thumps loudly in your chest as you wait for whatever is to come—a knock on the door, a break-in anything. You certainly aren't expecting a small leather notebook to slip through the crack under your door, though that's exactly what happens.\nAfter a moment, you breathe a sigh of relief and step forward to examine the notebook. It's an old handwritten accound describing the history of the strange town of Innsmouth as far back as the early eighteen hundreds, though the author goes unnamed. The record seems to focus primarily on Obed Marsh's founding of a strange organization called the Esoteric Order of Dagon. You don't remember any manuscripts of this sort on sale at the local bookstore, nor do you think the town has any libraries to speak of. Where was this notebook found, and who delivered it to you?\nCuriosity gets the better of you. You open the door to your hotel room, but the dim, dusty hallway lies bare before you. The identity of your benefactor eludes you. Still, you can't pass up a chance like this. For the remainder of the night, you study the record jotting notes in the margin as you draw connections between Innsmouth's past and the events of the past week. One thing becomes clear: whatever the Esoteric Order of Dagon is, its members must be the ones behind Agent Harper's kidnapping. And just as Agent Dawson suspected, their motives seem to have nothing to do with evading prohibition…",

Some kind of agreement not to speak of anything you might see or hear while working for the government, no doubt. Several minutes pass. You begin to wander throughout the office, examining the many books and maps Dawson has scattered around. Some are harmless enough-a medical textbook, a history of New England, a treatise on the anatomy of aquatic creatures throughout the Atlantic-but the volumes get stranger and stranger the more of his collection you examine.\nVenturing nearer to Dawson's side of the office, you notice that the many books, envelopes, and documents spread across the surface of his desk lie atop an unfolded map. You decide to chance a peek, hoping Dawson's task will keep him from his office for a while longer. Pushing some of the objects in your way aside, you examine the map. It is an enormous nautical chart of the world's oceans, marked in many spots with fresh black ink. A fountain pen lies nearby.\nThe marks that Dawson has made are curious, to say the least. There are over a dozen scattered across the seas. Some lie just off the coast of various continents, while others are in the middle of the ocean, their locations marked with wide, unfilled circles to show that their exact coordinates unknown. Strange words are scribbled next to each. P'tha'wei in the north Atlantic, near Greenland. Yhe'nthalla in the south Atlantic, just off the coast of Africa. R'lyeh deep in the south Pacific. Th'all-iewa by Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean. And at least ten more, some marked with question marks-an indication that this record is incomplete. You gently push aside the book that lies atop North America and see one more just off the coast of Massachusetts. Y'ha-nthlei.\nYou slam the brakes and screech to a halt as your mind pulls back to the present. <i>No. It can't be.</i> Your heart twists into a knot as you realize the truth. <i>No-!</i>\nY'ha-nthlei was not the home of the Deep Ones. It was just one of many."

Some distance up the beach from a saltwater pool and near the edge of a dense forest sit the remains of a quaint cottage.  It looks like a disaster photograph, with the thatch roof exploding upward and the wooden walls splintering out, but with each piece suspended in air.  You approach the house cautiously, and as you circle the building, you see the White Rabbit - the same one that traversed Arkham not long ago!  The rabbit wails anxiously to two other figures that regard him sadly -  a man and a lizard.  \"My house, my poor house!  Oh the monster that must have done this!\"\nThe dirt-caked man shakes his head forlornly and strokes his chin as he surveys the damage.  \"And a monster that didn't even finish what it started, your honor!  It didn't think to let the pieces fall before it vanished away!\"\n\"Never you mind the pieces, Pat!\" the White Rabbit snaps, \"Call someone to put it back together!  Oh, how late I shall be...\"\nYou take a half step forward, only for the grinning head of the Cheshire Cat to wink into existence before you.  \"The poor rabbit, not a roof over his head to speak of.\"  The cat's paw appears and gestures toward the shattered house.  \"As Gurathnaka claws at your world with its front, its back nails gouge into Wonderland.  The shadows crept at the corners until now, only seen by those who also lurk in the dark, solitary as oysters.\"  Its eyes glance in the direction of the beach and vanish, leaving only its smile to linger a few moments after.  You have only a few seconds to consider the cat's words.\n\"You there!\"  You look down from the suspended grin to see the White Rabbit looking up at you haughtily.  \"Standing with idle hands when there's a monster about!  Come come, help Bill to find this beast and drag it back! It has much to answer for!\"  His finger points to the lizard who tips his cap back at you hesitantly.\nBefore you can reply in any fashion, the White Rabbit turns back to the cottage and resumes his despairing.  You rub the back of your neck, at a loss for words as you weigh your options.  Forced into work as you are, there's a chance you might learn something by venturing out into the surf."

Wherever the darkness recedes, the landscape it leaves behind is warped and cracked.  You retrace your steps hesitantly, returning to the ground where the White Rabbit's house once stood.  Only scratched stone from the foundation remains, with no trace of the rabbit to speak of.  You can only speculate why the shadows lashed out as they did.  Perhaps your presence drove them ravenous for the taste of the real world, or perhaps they are merely running wild as their master occupies itself with Arkham.",

The sand around them is stained with darkness, and the last driplets of shadow leak from the corners of their mouths as they lie groaning.  \"A rotten bunch... it's shellfish poisoning, I'll wager...\" the Carpenter mumbles as he clutches his stomach.

Have you brought the monster with you?\"  You do your best to explain the ordeal, and the rabbit nods along with growing look of disturbance on his face.\nAs you end your tale, the White Rabbit jerks with a sudden twitch and grabs for his pocket watch.  \"No, no, I'm even more late now!  I must hurry!  Must find my gloves, or the Duchess will be furious!\"  He dashes towards the door, having completely dismissed you in his hurry.  You quickly try to question the rabbit further about Wonderland and the dangers ahead, but your words fall on deaf ears.

Ms. Liddell was quite cooperative upon her arrival and was granted a furnished room without restraints.  An orderly escorts you down one of the less unpleasant halls and into Alice's room.  She sits on the edge of the bed with her hands folded, and her head snaps up as you enter, apprehension plastered on her face.  Once you make it clear that you believe her story, however, Alice relaxes visibly, but her worried expression remains.\n\"What you saw was a dream,\" she explains slowly, \"one from my childhood of a strange place called Wonderland.  How innocent it once was...\" her voice trails off and she begins to tremble.  \"When I was younger, I believed it to be a real place.  It all seemed so real to me then, and it was that belief that drew the attention of something dark.  A great and terrible creature that dwells in shadows and feeds on dreams.  But rather than devour Wonderland, the creature strengthened it... no, raised it like cattle.  Fattened it.  Wonderland became more vivid and real than I ever imagined it could be, and it grew beyond my ability to control.  Now, in recent months, my dreams have begun to manifest in the real world.\"\nHer story is utterly fantastical, but you find yourself drawn in even more.  Alice continues with deep terror beginning to surface.  \"The creature is using me to bridge the gap of reality.  It wishes to merge the waking world with Wonderland in order to consume them both.  It began in my hometown in England, where the world began to unravel around me.  I fled, hoping to find a way to escape it, but it follows me no matter where I go.\"  Alice looks to you with exhausted desperation in her eyes.  \"And now that I cannot leave, it is only a matter of time until your own city of Arkham begins to unravel too.  You must find a way to stop this being, for your own sake if not for mine.  Please, you must find a way!\"\nYou reassure Alice to the best of your ability and depart the asylum, wondering how you can even begin this bizarre task.  As you exit, the familiar sight of Arkham's downtown district ripples before your eyes like a band of hot air in the summer, slowly beginning to distort.  Before you can act any further, a grinning mouth appears before you and a striped cat soon blossoms around it.  \"Welcome to Wonderland,\" it suddenly purrs, \"or perhaps you had better welcome Wonderland instead.  The longer you wait, the more of it there is... and the less of you there may be.  Gurathnaka is hungry, and it is very nearly supper time.\""

Everyone is mad in Wonderland, you see.  You yourself are beginning to go mad, or else you wouldn't be here.\"  You'd like to refute the cat, but you feel as if you are already walking a path of madness in trying to save Arkham from these bizarre occurrences.\nThe Cheshire Cat orbits you slowly, observing you from all angles as it speaks.  \"Still, I am a creature of Wonderland, and it is in my best interests to preserve my home, just as it is in your best interests to preserve yours.  Quizzically, Alice has entrusted you with both.\"  The cat rises up to stare you in the eye at an uncomfortably close distance.  \"You'll carry on, of course, but how will you carry on?  Like a surgeon, cutting out the infection?\" Its head detaches to punctuate the point.  \"Or like a miner, blasting all to oblivion?\"  The cat's body scatters as if blown apart, but the head remains eerily in place.  \"Whether you trim gently or tear it out by the roots, any future is preferable to being consumed utterly.  Alice would agree, I should think.  Assuming she is still lucid after being made into a gateway, of course.\"\nThe cat's head fades away, leaving only its grin behind once more.

You had hoped to preserve the city as much as possible, but it's almost insulting how little remains to prove your mission's success.  The possibility of it all being an invention of your own mind occurs, but you have no time to consider before the nurse returns to your bedside.  \"Excuse me, but if you're feeling well enough, a visitor is here to see you.\"  You sit up in bed with a surge of excitement as Alice enters your room with a small smile.  You both wait for the nurse to give you some privacy before she clasps your hand tightly.\n\"You've done it!\" Alice breathes, trying not to shout with joy.  The relief on her face is plain to see, and she looks far better than she did when you first saw her on the train and in the aslyum.  \"I truly can't thank you enough, especially as the evidence of all your struggles has all been returned to Wonderland.  You've done me - and the world at large - an incredible service.\"  You assure Alice that most of your adventures seem to escape the public's eye, but you would have done it all again in spite of the risks.  Alice settles down onto your bedside, and for a brief moment, her smile dips with sadness.  You ask Alice how she's been holding up amid all this, as the key piece of Gurathnaka's plot.\n\"I don't quite know yet,\" she replies with a far-off look in her eye, \"I may never be the same again after all that happened, and this may not yet be the end.  I know that the shadows aren't gone for good.  I can still feel them grasping at the edges of my dreams.\"  Alice looks back to you gratefully and her smile returns.  \"But for the first time in over a decade, I can sleep without fear.  Both for myself and for the world around me.\"  You think back on your journey through Wonderland, and you ask Alice about what has befallen her strange dreams."

The minutes pass until finally, the nurse intrudes once more.  \"I'm afraid that visiting hours have ended,\" she says cheerfully before ducking out to pass the same message onto other rooms.  Alice rises with a final clasp of your hands, resolution clear on her face.  \"I've decided,\" she states plainly, \"I'm going to remain here in Arkham.\"  You raise your eyebrow in surprise.  Few people who know the mysteries and horrors of this town live to recount them, and fewer still willingly face more.  \"I've learned from several others in the city here that Arkham has many mysteries of its own.  If I can help to solve even one of them, then perhaps I can begin to repay you for your kindness and bravery.\""

It's always been one of those stories that mixes whimsy and unease in just the right amounts, and it makes no secrets about madness.  The Alice stories have had darker interpretations in the past, from American McGee to Tim Burton, but each had their own stories that they wanted to tell.  My goal for this campaign was to stay as true to the books as I could while making it an adventure worthy of the Arkham Horror investigators.  I didn't want to just change Wonderland's madness; I wanted to add it to Lovecraftian madness instead.\nI created the bulk of this campaign while the official Dream-Eaters campaign was still being released, and I intentionally avoided reading into it until I had the basics for the Wonderland gameplay set.  If there were going to be two campaigns about dream journeys and irritating cats, then I wanted to make sure that this one wasn't being a copycat.\nThere were three main challenges in creating the campaign.  First, I wanted to include everything from the Alice books that I possibly could, and to stay as true to those characters as I could.  The stories have an expansive cast, and everyone has their favorites, and I hopefully succeeded in doing each of them justice.  Some unrelated characters and stories had to be combined for the sake of individual scenarios, but in a sense, it was the only way to fit everything in.  In another sense, it helped with the second challenge: making the middle six scenarios scale properly from either side.  The interludes allowed me to give a spotlight to some characters that didn't fit into the scenarios while ramping up the difficulty both ways.\nThe third challenge was making Alice herself both relevant and central to the story without making her more important than the investigators, in a sense.  In my mind, she was important enough to be more than just an ally, so she became a full investigator, but only for the final scenario.  By including her fragments in each scenario and her indirect assistance in the interludes, it gave the players that she was accompanying them in spirit, and made her involvement in the final scenario a little more personal.\nAs a side note for the mythos involvement, I chose Gurathnaka specifically because there was little information other than that it was a shadowy eater of dreams.  This gave me plenty of room to improvise with the story.  Gurathnaka was created by Matthew Grau for the futuristic CthulhuTech setting, but future mythos must have been past mythos as well.  An ancient one's ambition to eat more than just dreams made the perfect catalyst for the campaign.\nThanks again for playing!"

A traveling Englishwoman by the name of Alice Liddell collapsed screaming as the train arrived at Arkham's Northside station.  Other passengers tried to console her, but Ms. Liddell was in a state of sheer panic.  \"The man dressed in newspaper... the goat and the beetle... you saw them too, didn't you?\" she plead to the onlookers, but they only shook their heads in bewilderment.  \"It's still following me, after all this distance... how far will be far enough?!\"  The young woman's panic quickly mounted, and the passengers called for the conductor to escort her off the train.  She begged them not to keep her, that she must continue her journey immediately, but her protests were ignored.  Who could believe such a preposterous story?  You yourself might have doubted her too had you not also seen these strange figures that Alice described in the brief moment before she collapsed.\nYou depart the train as soon as possible, but find no trace of Ms. Liddell on the platform.  Porters tell you that the police got involved and decided to take her to Arkham Asylum for temporary care.  You wrinkle your nose at the prospect of the infamous sanitarium doing her any sort of good.  Whatever Alice saw on the train must have existed, however briefly, and you must speak with her to find out what it was and why it fills her with such a powerful dread.  You head home to prepare to have an in-depth talk with Ms. Liddell.\nArkham has long been plagued by the weird, ghoulish, and arcane.  It may not have been as big a shock to you as it might have been to others, but the fact that a foreigner was affected immediately upon arriving in Arkham strikes you especially oddly.  As you gather your things at home, your mind runs over the hundreds of possible evils that could be haunting Ms. Liddell, each less pleasant than the last.  You pocket some weapons and extra materials on the offchance that you'll have to confront anything sinister.\nYour own house lies across the city from the asylum, giving you plenty of time to speculate as you trek over to Arkham's downtown district.  You hope that it's just your eyes playing on your fears, but the city seems darker than it should be for a summer afternoon."

The glade itself is also shaped like a heart, tapering inward toward an especially large tree with a red door embedded in it.  Whoever - or whatever - created this grove may be able to help you in stabilizing Alice's dreams.  You step through the door without delay.\nThe other side of the door might as well have been another world, as it leads to a vast garden surrounding an enormous castle.  The same heart patterns adorn each flowerbed and topiary bush, most decorated in a bright red color.  You have only a moment to consider who would be so fixated on hearts before a platoon of strange figures approach you.  The figures look like playing cards in all four suits, but each with heads, hands and feet.  The fact that they brandish spears at you vindictively takes some of the humor out of their appearance.  You raise your hands to diffuse the situation just as the ranks of the cards part.\nAnother regal figure walks proudly but aggressively toward you.  From her appearance, and connecting the look of the castle around you, it could only be the Queen of Hearts.  She keeps her jaw tightly clenched as she regards you with suspicion.  After a few moments, she begins to speak in a tone that suggests inner rage.  \"And who are you to intrude upon my castle?!\" she accuses gruffly, \"Just the sort of unseemly type to skulk and thieve!\"  You try to smooth things over with the intimidating monarch, but she scoffs openly at you.  \"Don't contradict a queen!  You appear scant moments after my tarts were stolen away, on my unbirthday, no less, and you try to claim coincidence?!  Rubbish and lies!  Off with your head!\"  She storms away, still bellowing for blood, and her entourage of soldiers merely bars your exit.  You wait for a moment in confused silence as nobody attempts to take you away for execution.  Either this is commonplace, or the executioner isn't a real go-getter.\nThe Cheshire Cat appears beside you once more, watching the queen and her soldiers depart.  \"Heady times indeed,\" it purrs, \"and you have the great luck of being here at the crux of it.  The queen does love her tarts so, nearly as much as she loves a good beheading.\"  The cat's head floats away from its body as he speaks to punctuate his statement.  \"They'll have a trial shortly, I should think, but were I you, I wouldn't want my name at the top of any lists.  Blame is the name of the game at the Queen's court, and you would do well to learn it quickly.  But I've every confidence in you.  You've a good head on your shoulders... for now.\"  It vanishes once more with a wide grin, leaving you to figure out how best to save your neck from the headsman's axe."

The disorganized chaos of the rest of Wonderland is almost a relief compared to the nonsensical bureaucracy of the Queen of Hearts.  You rest for a short while before standing slowly, using the tree to brace yourself.  Before you can finish standing, however, you are violently thrown to the ground as something slams against the opposite side of the door.  You scramble back from the door in time to see it ripped from its hinges by a shadowy claw.\nThrough the open portal, you can see that the Queen's castle has devolved into pandemonium as shadowy monsters claw it apart rapidly.  The ornate palace and gardens crumble and scatter as the creatures rampage in their pursuit of victims.  The shrieks and wails of the courtiers and guards are only outmatched by the fierce and violent cries of the Queen of Hearts herself.  She may have been a match for the shadows on her own terms, but as Gurathnaka's minions consume her court and palace, they grow too much even for the bloodthirsty royal to overcome.\nYou continue your escape before you risk death a second time, fleeing back into the surrounding woods before the shadows can overtake you.  The enraged echoes of the Queen's voice reach you long after you lose sight of the glade, but they are finally and suddenly stifled, and a stark stillness falls over the forest.

You might feel at ease, were it not for the glimpses of strange creatures and wisps of shadows each time you look back over your shoulder.\nYour worries are compounded as the landscape smooths out to tidy fields in perfect squares.  Immaculate hedge rows and canals line each plot of land.  The grass of each alternates between darker and lighter shades to contrast with its neighbors.  The parallel with a chess board occurs to you at the same moment that you catch sight of several enormous white chess pieces, alive as any person and grouped together fearfully.  The pieces regard your approach warily and hold themselves proudly until a distant creaking and cracking sends them back to shuddering timidly.\nA massive storm of shadows looms several fields beyond your own, churning but stationary.  \"It is a travesty, is it not?\"  You turn to find the White King staring grimly at the fearsome event alongside you.  \"To think we once fought with such chivalry according to the Rules of Battle with the red army.\"  You press the king on his comments, and he realizes rather suddenly that you are not a native of Wonderland.\n\"You are perhaps another visitor from Alice's domain?  You have impeccable timing.  Completely wrong, but impeccable.  My own army has lost its nerve completely, and I am in need of new pawns.  Strong and keen, brave and true.\"  The King looks to you and stares in uncomfortable silence with a disappointed look stamped on his face.  \"You will have to do.\"  You attempt to protest being drafted, but the White King snorts impudently.  \"Hush hush, it's an honor to serve a king, you know!  All you must do is travel to the eighth square and capture the Red King.  Defeat the Red Queen as well, if you are able.  You will of course meet with some opposition, but I'm confident - no, confident is the wrong word.  Optimistic?  Satisfied?  Yes, that will do - satisfied that you will find success.\"\nIrritation builds within you at the White King's haughtiness, but you consider the situation carefully.  You entered Wonderland to seek out and destroy Gurathnaka's shadows, and such a target is now within your sight.  With any luck, you might even be able to convince some of the other white chess pieces to assist you in stamping out this corruption.  With some resignation, you accept the White King's badgering and proceed to the edge of his defenses.  The Cheshire Cat grins down at you from the battlements, lounging lazily but eyes fixed on the distant shadows permeating the far side of the chess board."

Few are able to keep pace with a queen at all, but you have done so splendidly!  With skill such as yours, why, I dare say you have the makings of a fine knight within you!\"  The knight's lack of perspective is oddly refreshing amid the horrors being wreaked by the shadows, and you give him an appreciative nod."

The landscape tears as you flee, ripped apart by the sudden surge of shadows while the red pieces rush forward to finish the defenders.  It seems as if you may be overwhelmed as well, but the shifting landscape opens up a gap in the orderly hedge rows.  You dive through without hesitation and hunker down as the land around you shudders in destruction.\nMinutes pass, and finally the wild din fades, replaced again by an eerie silence.  You emerge from the hedges to find the entire battlefield now marred and blasted by the dark surge.  Bodies of defeated chess pieces lie strewn about the fields, most of them cracked and contorted from whatever force ripped them apart.  You glance in the direction of the Red King's castle to see it as you first did: a red shard in a dark vortex.  Slowly you make your way back towards the ruined defenses of the White King to search for survivors.\nScattered stone and derelict pillars are all that remain of the white castle you first set out from.  Many of the missing chunks of masonry look as though they were bitten or clawed apart rather than shattered.  The trail of destruction leads directly to the throne of the White King.  You find his body on the steps to his throne, shredded to unrecognizable state but for the crown he once wore.  You realize now just how deeply the shadows have divided Wonderland.  The two sides may have once met in combat honorably, as the white pieces expected to fight, but Gurathnaka's corruption transformed the red pieces into remorseless monsters that share its hunger.  You depart solemnly to recuperate and find a new battlefield to face the shadows upon."

Moments pass without event, and gradually the sound of the Red King's labored breathing magnifies.  You turn him over and are astonished to find that despite his injuries, the king is asleep!  You open the Red King's eyes manually, only to find them filled with swirling darkness.  Whatever shadowy power has possessed the king is keeping him alive even in this state.  You ponder the possibilities and it soon becomes clear to you what has happened.  Gurathnaka is an eater of dreams, and even the denizens of a dream can have dreams of their own.  The Red King's dreams sustain the shadows as they try to consume both Wonderland and Arkham.  You grimace with pity as you deliver the merciful killing blow to the Red King.\nAs the death blow lands, the shadows retreat from the castle with an echoing shriek.  The remaining red chess pieces, however, turn to retire without any sound or expression.  Perhaps some core principle drives them to obey the rules of chess even when controlled by Gurathnaka's shadows.  Whatever the reason, you're relieved that you won't have to fight your way back out of the castle.\nYou return wearily across the battlefield to the opposing castle of the White King, who meets you proudly.  \"A fine victory, just fine!  I knew I was right to put my confidence - no, wait, it was satisfaction - satisfaction in you!  Come now, we must feast and revel before we go to gloat of our victory to the Red King!\"  You say nothing, not wanting to sour the mood and possibly upset the White King.  If there's one thing you've learned, it's that the inhabitants of Wonderland are notoriously short-tempered.  You give a noncommittal answer and let the king return to his celebration as you quietly depart."

Even in an open field where the sun beams down on you from above, you scan the horizon in constant search for any sign of approaching darkness.  Have the shadows been curbed at all by your efforts, or are they unstoppable while their master prepares to feast on Arkham?  The questions tax your psyche further as you continue your trek through Wonderland.\nYour vigilance finally pays off as you spot an airborne figure moving toward you at great speed.  You brace for a fight, but it wheels up high above you, circling like a vulture around a dying animal.  You remain still on the sunny field, dreading what the strange entity might be all the while.  Tense moments pass before the figure descends in a surprising burst of speed and lands in the tall grass before you.  The strange beast before you is equally split between eagle and lion: a gryphon in the flesh if ever there was one, and it regards you curiously as it settles its wings.\n\"Another visitor to Wonderland?  How very peculiar!\"  It leans uncomfortably close to you and strokes the underside of its beak with one claw pensively.  \"You've chosen a poor time for sight-seeing, I'm sorry to say.  The stability of the place has been lacking, and those shadowy beasts have been gnawing about like termites!\"  Your relief at meeting a more congenial resident of Wonderland is quickly replaced by your unease at the Gryphon's statements.  The Gryphon takes note of your concern and nods sagely.  \"Curious to see the trouble yourself?  My, but you're a morbid sort, but it just might take such a sort to sort through it all!\"  The Gryphon chuckles and puffs up a bit at his own play on words, reveling for a moment before turning his side to you.  \"Come, come, don't shy away now!  The only way to see the state of things is from the air!\"  Again you find yourself with conflicting feelings.  On the one hand, this could help you gather information easily, and even assist in your travels.  On the other hand, however, being hundreds of feet up in the air on the back of one of Wonderland's capricious creatures could prove fatal.  Your curiosity wins out in the end, however, and you climb onto the Gryphon's back gingerly."

      "text": "\"Satisfied?\" the Gryphon probes, \"The view is much less dismal from the ground.\"  You consider the state of Wonderland and the shadows once more briefly before you nod.  At once, the Gryphon wheels back down to earth, swooping this time toward a quiet lagoon on the edge of a vast body of water.  \"Come, I know just the thing to liven your spirits after such a sight!  My friend the Mock Turtle is quite a songster, to say nothing of his education!\"  You try to envision just what a mock turtle might look like, but the creature the Gryphon lands next to doesn't match any of your ideas.  The Mock Turtle resembles a sea turtle but with the head of a cow.  He sits at the water's edge, staring down into the pools with a smile on his face, but tears leaking from his eyes.  \"Ahoy and what ho!\" the Gryphon calls out, \"enjoying the dance?\"\n\"It's a sight for sore feet,\" the Mock Turtle murmurs with a nod.  You give the creature a hesitant hello and he waves a flipper at you without looking.  His attention is firmly fixed on the waves in front of him.  You stand beside the Mock Turtle and look into the water, seeing at once a bizarre spectacle.  Sea creatures of a hundred varieties dance together in a complicated but stately fashion just under the water's surface.  The Mock Turtle splashes his flippers in the surf in time with the muffled music, still sniffling but enjoying himself.\nNot wanting to ask the Mock Turtle bluntly, you take the Gryphon aside and quietly question why the creature is in such an emotional state.  \"The poor fellow knows the state of Wonderland as well as I do,\" the Gryphon responds with a pitying glance at its friend, \"he often used to cry in his spare time, but now that he's found something serious to give him sorrow, he's doing all he can to distract himself.\"  The Mock Turtle hums to himself as the dancing continues, utterly enthralled.  \"It's for the best, don't you know!\" the Gryphon chuckles, \"no sense dwelling on such grim matters\"\nYou frown at the Gryphon's statement.  Sitting by idly is only going to help Gurathnaka in its conquest.  You warn the two creatures of the dangers the hungry shadows could pose if left unchecked.  The Mock Turtle covers his ears with two flippers and shakes his head, while the Gryphon scowls at your stories.  \"Such topics aren't polite, not one jot!\" the Gryphon scolds you.  The Mock Turtle nods with a whimper and chimes in after.  \"There's so much misery to be had, only let us ration it!  Let us sing of soup and schools, and join the lobsters in their quadrille!\""

You spare no detail in the power, the relentlessness, and the wanton destruction the shadows are capable of.  The Gryphon brushes off each grim retelling, and the Mock Turtle shakes his head woefully, trying not to listen.  It is only when you begin talking about Arkham's destruction that the conversation seems to affect them.\nYou describe the chaos and madness that engulfed the city when last you saw it.  Each place and person you once held dear will be lost forever if you can't find a way to root Gurathnaka out of Alice's dreams.  The Mock Turtle bursts into a fresh cascade of tears while the Gryphon draws upward indignantly.  \"That is quite enough!\" he bellows, \"the poor fellow has delicate sensibilities, you know!  And now that you've-\"\n\"No...\" the Mock Turtle blubbers, placing a flipper between the two of you, \"what's made me sad is that... is that I've been so intolerably selfish... we both have...\" the Gryphon's beak opens in shock and he stumbles over his words, but can't voice any protest to the statement.  \"To think that such sorrow was inside you... we simply must help.\"  The Gryphon regains his composure quickly, and though he still looks irritated at being made to look callous, he nods with a grumbling agreement."

With a resigned sigh, you turn away to rediscover the path, when you notice the daylight around you beginning to dim.\nWisps of shadow creep along the ground toward the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, seeping inside them like water to a sponge.  You back away cautiously, hoping that they will continue to ignore you even as the shadows begin to corrupt them.  The tears that drip down the Mock Turtle's face darken until he cries dark liquid rivulets, while the Gryphon swells in size to match its overflowing pride.  Not wanting to risk another attack, you make a swift retreat from the darkening scene.\nYour steps are suddenly halted as you feel a tug at your back, as if you had been leashed.  You look down and discover that your shadow stretches far behind you, as if tethered to the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle.  They turn to you, the one with a predatory eye and the other with trickling darkness on his.  \"You musn't go...\" the Mock Turtle moans with a distorted tone.  \"There is only sorrow out there... come and sit...\" the Gryphon echoes hollowly.  You struggle forward desperately as you feel yourself being reeled back toward them, until at last you jerk forward with a snap.  With the tether gone, you waste no time in making your escape."

You try to orient yourself from what you recall of the landscape from the back of the Gryphon, but it's all somehow wrong.  Once again, Wonderland seems to be shifting to keep you out - or at this point, in.\nAs you stare about the jumbled countryside, a single feather drifts into view, much like one from the Gryphon's own coat.  You look up to see hundreds of feathers floating on the breeze, slowly shifting into a long line that winds through the trees and over the rolling hills.  You have a feeling that you have Alice to thank once again for helping you navigate this madcap world.\nYou march forward, following the feather trail while it lasts, but your thoughts drift backward to the view from the Gryphon's back.  The balance between Wonderland's stability and Gurathnaka's advance is more precarious than you first imagined.  Questions and fears mix in your mind with each step forward.  Will the discoveries and insights you've gained be enough to beat back the shadows from Arkham?  Has Arkham already been reduced to irreversible ruin?  Or will you even be able to escape from Wonderland back into the real world at all?  Each question returns you the same answer: you won't know until you've tried.  With everything else in Wonderland so uncertain, the one thing you have to trust is your own decisions, come what may.  You press on, for better or worse, braced for the consequences."

It stretches towards the horizon in either direction, making you doubt if a way around it exists.  Climbing doesn't seem to be an option either, as it stands at the height of a house without any possible footholds.  Exasperated, you begin walking its length in hopes of finding any kind of door or passage through.\nSome distance down the wall, you spot a rotund figure perched atop it.  As you draw close, the silhouette of an egg with legs grows clearer.  You doubt your own eyes for a moment, but who else could it possibly be but Humpty Dumpty from the old nursery rhyme?  He sits atop the wall with his eyes closed and his fist on his chin (or at least the part of his body that passes for his chin) in deep thought.  You call up to him, but he hisses down at you.\n\"Don't speak!  Move away!  Or you might bring the end about quicker!\" Humpty spits at you, trying to remain oblivious to you.  You insist in confusion, and finally he looks down at you with a mixture of annoyance and dread.  \"Now you've done it!  I was safe while I was deep in ponderance!\"  You question whether the word means what he thinks, but he shakes his head - or himself, rather.  \"When I use a word, it means precisely what I wish it to mean!  Otherwise, what good would it be?\"  You decide not to press him on that point and ask again about the end he mentioned earlier.\n\"The end, don't you see?  The others may not see it, but surely you can.  I can recognize one of Alice's ilk when I see one, not from Wonderland at all.  You know as well as I that this land is but a dream, and I, drawn from a sad and dismal tale, am doomed to a gravitic fate!\"  You begin to see Humpty's worries.  Sat on a wall, had a great fall, couldn't be put back together again.  You assert that the children's story and his existence are two separate things, but his expression only grows darker.  \"It's no use!  The printed word is my fate, and that's the end of it.  It's simply my means to an end, and always has been.\"  Humpty's stare grows unfocused, and he begins to wobble atop the wall."

Humpty wags a finger up at you as he continues ranting.  \"Simply don't accept it, what an utterly intangible thought!  What reason should I have to believe that I should survive a fall from up-\" he points up to his former perch and pauses in thought, \"-up there.  Down to... here?\"  Humpty takes a quick stock of his surroundings and kneads the grass beneath his shoes as the truth dawns on him.  \"I'm... vivacious!  Undisturbed!  There was no great fall or failure to repurpose my pieces!\"  He leaps into the air and clicks his heels in joy as you simply stand by and watch, bemused.  Humpty revels for a few moments longer before he grabs your hand and shakes it vigorously.  \"Well met indeed, then!  You've assuredly granted me a new perspective.  Why, I might do a great many other things now that I've regained myself!\"  You tell Humpty to take it easy for a while, not wanting to turn him into a daredevil.  His fate is his own, but an egg's still an egg."

And if you don't believe me, then-\" Humpty stops mid-sentence as he realizes his wild rocking has upset his balance completely.  He claws at the bricks in a moment of panic, but it's too late to stop from careening over the edge.  You try to help break his fall, but his wild earlier motions send him on a strange trajectory.  Humpty's wail of terror ends abruptly as his body crashes onto the ground, shattering like a vase.  You shake your head at the egg's shortsightedness and look over his remains.  It would be an impossible task fitting him back together, and whether or not that would actually revive him is anyone's guess.

Before you can act, however, the sound of scraping bricks meets your ears.  You scan the wall for the source of the sound, but you can't pinpoint it.  Upon closer inspection, the entire wall seems to be trembling slightly.  A tremendous rumbling begins to sound through the bricks, and you take several steps backward, looking down to either end of the wall.  The top layer of the wall rises like a wave, and a ripple of displaced masonry works down from either end, looking to meet up at your spot.  You leap backward even further as the bricks collide with a crash, and a cloud of powdered mortar obscures your vision.\nThe dust settles quickly in the silence of the aftermath, and the wall before you has been cracked at the top, with loose bricks now forming a rough ramp upward.

The house is identical to the strange empty one that manifested in Arkham, though it is mirrored from what you remember.  You enter the house with a rush of excitement all the same, though uncertain what you will find inside.  Unlike the barren cottage you explored not so long ago, this house is filled with an uncomfortable clutter, and most of it levitating in random spots.  Finding a passage through the rooms proves more difficult than you expected, but at last you make your way to the strange parlor you briefly viewed through the mirror in Arkham.  A mirror also adorns this mantle, but the reflection is clouded by darkness, so much that you can barely make out your own image on it.  You place a hand on the mirror and press gently, and it bows like a rotted timber.  With few other options, you scale the fireplace and lean forward into the malleable mirror."

      "text": "Following the map to the best of your abilities, you skirt the water's edge before cutting inland sharply.  Some short distance through the underbrush, your path reaches its terminus at a door embedded in a dirt hillock.  With no reason to hesitate, you open the door and squeeze inside.  The other side doesn't match up with your expectations at all, appearing as a labyrinth of thousands of doors down several branching corridors.  Wearily, you trudge forward, picking a path and proceeding methodically.  Your method soon gives way to madness, however, as the tight corridors open up and the walls seem to fall away from you, as if ejecting from reality altogether.  Gravity turns at random, and you struggle for footing as the long hallways funnel up and down.  As the dread of being forever lost begins to grow, a blinding light beams down at you from a narrow tunnel.  Your footing slips once again, and you begin falling - upward, it seems - toward it.  With scant seconds to brace, you ready yourself for the worst."

From the fading twilight, you can only conclude that you've been gone from Arkham a matter of minutes, in spite of the days and nights you spent in Wonderland.  Your bewildered observation is interrupted by an unearthly noise, one that you know in your soul could only be made by one thing.  You turn toward the south side of the city to gaze at the shadowy form of Gurathnaka."

It soon becomes clear that you are lying in one of the many beds of St. Mary's Hospital, with bandages and casts wrapped tightly in place.  You lie in a daze until a nurse approaches you with a relaxed manner.  \"You're lucky to be alive!\" she encourages, inspecting some of your more superficial wounds, \"You must have been hit by a car or something even larger!\"  Questions flow out of your mouth, and the nurse responds without the least bit of concern.  She, and the rest of Arkham, doesn't recall anything about shadows or the upheaval of reality that you experienced.  By her account, you were discovered last night on the north end of the city and brought to the hospital for treatment.\nDays pass until you are considered fit enough to leave the hospital of your own accord, and in that time, your dreams are plagued by visions of the shadows you fought.  Once cleared, you head directly toward Arkham Asylum and inquire frantically at the front desk about Alice's well-being.  The receptionist shakes his head and gives a resigned sigh.  \"You hadn't heard?  Miss Liddell passed away last week from complications of an epileptic fit.

Your thoughts aren't fully sorted by the time a nurse enters with a small meal for you.  \"You're awake already!

The shadows, the brief overlap with Wonderland, and the distorting chaos all fail to get any reaction out of her, other than a suspicious smile.  \"Now it's none of my business, but you really ought to be more careful if you're, erm... drinking anything stronger than water.  Next time, you could end up with more than a few bruises!  Don't worry, your secret is safe here.\"  You attempt to reason with the nurse, but she simply pats you on the hand and insists you eat.

The illusion of safety in the wide plains makes the darkened forests look all the more sinister.  Shadows flit around every fallen log and bed of moss, making each step forward a nervous one.  Where will Gurathnaka's hungry minions strike from this time?  As if to answer your question, a pair of dark claws extend from a rotted stump, but before you can beat them back, a shaking sound echoes from within the woods, and the shadows retreat.  Curiosity strikes you at the swift result, and you head a little deeper into the woods to find the source of the noise.\nEven after what you've seen in Wonderland, the sight that greets you seems far-fetched.  Two rotund figures of indeterminate age stand in a clearing, fighting back and forth over a small object.  It takes a moment of observation before it occurs to you that the two look exactly like Tweedledum and Tweedledee from the old nursery rhyme.  They're currently tussling with each other over a toy rattle, which you quickly identify as the source of the strange noise from before.  You look to the edges of the clearing and confirm that each wild shake of the rattle causes the creeping shadows to shrink away.  Strange as it seems, it may help your mission to get that rattle.\nYou step closer to the two and try to interject, but the twins look to you indignantly.  \"It's rude to interrupt!\" Tweedledee snaps at you with a sneer.  \"Contrariwise, it's polite to say nothing at all!\" Tweedledum chimes in.  They ignore your attempts at reasoning and bargaining as they return to their tug-of-war.  \"It's my rattle and I shan't let you take it!\" Tweedledum grunts at his brother.  \"You've had your fun!  It's my turn now!\" Tweedledee spits back.  The two pull on the rattle until a wooden crack echoes out, and each collapses back with half of it.  \"You broke it!\" Tweedledum cries out, though his brother shakes his head and sneers \"Didn't!\"  The pair storm off before you can intervene or mediate, shouting threats of war at each other.\nYou sigh in irritation.  At first you consider just snatching the pieces of the rattle away from them, but your plan is quickly stifled by the sudden appearance of two massive armies of figures.  One battalion is made of living playing cards, and the other of living chess pieces, each siding with one of the Tweedles, who are busy strapping household objects to themselves for protection.  The Cheshire Cat appears between you with the same telltale grin, but a roll of his eyes.  \"Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle.  Surely you know the rest,\" it purrs as the combatants take places across a small wooded valley from each other.  Once again, you've been caught up in the nonsense of Wonderland's strange citizens.  Still, if at all possible, you've got to get your hands on that rattle."

Whether the roads have always been tangled or whether Gurathnaka has twisted the dream land is unclear, but you keep up your trek regardless.  At a crossroad at the edge of a large patch forest, you stop to consider carefully, only for the Cheshire Cat to appear once more on a branch above you.  \"I remember this spot well,\" he purrs, sweeping both his front paws to either side, \"In that direction lives a Hare, and in the other lives a Hatter, both quite mad.\"  You give an exasperated sigh.  Most of the citizens of Wonderland have been more than a little unhinged, but for the cat to make a note of these two speaks to just how crazy they might be.  \"They are likely to be at the hare's house, as it is nearly tea time.  Then again, it is always nearly tea time with those three.\"  The cat fades away once more before you can get any more details.  You puzzle over the cat's words carefully.  Tea for three, but he only mentioned the hare and hatter.  You expect it was the cat's way of guiding you to the third figure while maintaining its cryptic madness.\nYou follow the weaving road toward the Hare's house, unsure of what to expect.  The path veers off into the woods, but very quickly dead ends in a small cottage.  The house looks uninhabited, but the sounds of laughter and clinking of china lead you around to a side garden.  A long table stretches out across much of the small garden, stacked high with tea cups and pots, bread and butter, and all other manner of refreshments.  The Hare and the Hatter sit across from one another, conversing loudly, though their words seem like complete gibberish to you.  In the center of the table, a Dormouse peeks out of a teapot, disheveled and looking quite exhausted.  He looks up with drooping eyelids as you approach, looking as though he had something important to say but quite forgot it.  Before you can greet each other, the Dormouse's eyes close and he sinks back into the teapot with a long sigh.\nAll at once, as the Dormouse sinks to sleep, shadows sweep in from the edges of the garden.  You leap into one of the chairs, only for the Hare and Hatter to turn their attention to you with offended expressions.  \"No room, no room!\" they chide, seemingly oblivious to the encroaching darkness.  You brace for the wave of shadows, but instead, you feel a flutter in your stomach as your chair rises into the air.  The table and other chairs follow in short order, rising just above the consuming darkness.  \"It's very rude to sit down without being invited, you know!\" the Hare continues.  The Hatter nods in agreement before chiming in.  \"But since you're here, try to guess this riddle, if you can!\"  You nod half-heartedly at the tea party hosts as you begin to figure your way out of this dilemma."

Investigators cannot enter [[Chair]] locations that are occupied by another investigator or enemy.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may swap positions with other investigators and enemies using the abilities listed below.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\nBecause of these restrictions, investigators at [[Chair]] locations are considered to be engaged with each non-aloof enemy at each connecting [[Chair]] location.  Players may engage, attack, evade, parley, and activate effects as if those enemies were at their location.  Enemies may also attack and activate effects as if they were at the engaged investigators' locations.  After an enemy enters a [[Chair]] location, it engages all investigators at all connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Failed attacks against enemies engaged with multiple investigators do not deal damage to other investigators.  If an investigator moves while engaged with any amount of enemies at [[Chair]] locations, those enemies make attacks of opportunity normally, but do not move after attacking.  If an investigator or enemy would move to an investigator's location via a card effect, move them to the nearest empty [[Chair]] location instead.\nWhen an enemy would move between two [[Chair]] locations, but its path is blocked by another enemy or an investigator who did not trigger this movement, swap its position with that other enemy or investigator.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\nInvestigators at [[Chair]] locations may commit cards to skill tests performed by investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at your location may target investigators or enemies at a connecting [[Chair]] locations instead.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at connecting or other locations are unchanged.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may interact with cards in the threat areas of investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.\nInvestigators may take the following two actions at any time during the scenario:\n[action] If you are at a [[Chair]] location: <b>Move</b>.  Swap positions with an investigator at a connecting [[Chair]] location.  This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the other investigator.\n[action] If you are at a [[Chair]] location: <b>Parley</b>.  Swap positions with an enemy at a connecting [[Chair]] location."

You keep your distance, remembering how they behaved during the earlier chaos, but they act as though nothing had happened.  \"Come now, a bright guest like you can surely think of a riddle we haven't heard before!\" the Hare invites, bounding over to escort you to a closer chair.  Your thoughts jumble and your words stumble, but your recent experience inspires a question.  When can you be in the dark and in the light at the same time?  The duo scratch their chins and tap their spoons idly, spending several seconds in thought.  Finally, the Hare draws upward and raises a finger.  \"When it's day out, but you've no idea what's going on!\" he proudly proclaims.\n\"No, no!  It's quite the opposite!\" the Hatter scoffs, \"When you know exactly what is going on, but it's dark all around!  After all, it was pitch black only a moment ago and we knew precisely what happened!\"  You raise an eyebrow at the suggestion that they were aware of the danger the entire time.  The Hatter pulls you closer and lowers his voice to a whisper that's somehow louder than his speaking voice.  \"Everyone is mad here, you know.  The things that make sense, well, those belong in Alice's world.  And the shadows are rather picky.  Why, poor Dormy here started making sense and they went after him just like that!\"  You press the two mad partygoers further, and to your surprise, they divulge plenty of details about Gurathnaka and his brood.\nThe Dormouse gives a long sigh and smiles faintly as he continues waking up fully.  \"They may be mad, but friends are friends.  I'm quite surprised - and happy, mind you - that you didn't give them a thrashing for their trouble.\"",

Each trampled trail you find works aimlessly back upon itself to the point where you make better progress forging your own path.  You walk for hour after hour, staving off the strange creatures and trying your best to make sense of the baffling landscape.  Your progress is further hampered as a thick fog creeps over the woods.  You can barely see the distance from one tree to the next, slowing your pace to a staggered walk.  Gradually, you discover an aroma mixed in with the fog, faint but strangely exotic.  The fog slowly transitions to smoke, giving you no further vision, but a clear trail.  You follow the strengthening smell to a secluded copse, covered on every available surface by a hundred varieties of mushroom.\nAtop one of the mushrooms sits a large caterpillar lounging with a hookah beside him.  His eyes rise to meet yours, but he reacts with complete indifference.  \"Who are YOU?\" the Caterpillar demands with smoke streaming from his pursed lips.  You open your mouth to explain, but the insect holds up one of his many arms.  \"Explain once you are the correct size.\"  He breaks off a piece of his toadstool seat and holds it up lazily.  \"This will correct you.\"  You accept with no small amount of consideration, assuring yourself that this is the one case where you would reasonably take mushrooms from a talking caterpillar.  Within moments of taking the bite, you shrink down to a minuscule size.  Satisfied with looking down at you, the Caterpillar takes another long drag of smoke before he continues.  \"The other side will make you grow larger,\" he instructs, breaking off another piece from the opposite side of his mushroom and offering it to you.  \"Now speak.  Who are YOU?\"\nIt's a difficult task explaining the events that brought you here, made all the more uncomfortable by the Caterpillar's apparent lack of interest and attention.  \"Stop,\" he orders at last, drawing upward slightly, \"Where you have been and what you have done are quite different from who you are.\"  You try to tell a bit of your background and motivations instead, but the Caterpillar remains dismissive of your story.  \"You are not the same as you used to be,\" he accuses with a snort, \"Everyone changes, but you have changed far too quickly.  Discover yourself once more.\"  His many hands extend, offering his hookah pipe down toward you."

You look to the Caterpillar and find him steadily watching you, perhaps the only anchored figure in the swirling smoke around you.  As the moments pass, you find that the color isn't a figment of your vision at all, but rather a projected light that forms a small mote in the surrounding smoke.  The points of light quickly multiply, shining through the haze in a mosaic pattern.  You look down at yourself to see the colors beaming back onto your body.  Where each light shines, a different facet of yourself manifests.  Courage and conviction intermingled with fear and apprehension.  Talent and ineptitude in equal amounts.  Shadows creep in at the edge of each facet, only to be banished by the overflow from other connecting lights.  The display cascades in front of your eyes with increasing violence, overwhelming your senses and spiking into your mind.  You lose track of the time as moments slip by in dazzling flashes.\nSuddenly, your eyes snap open.  You are lying on the ground, nothing above you but the clouds of smoke, and no sound but the rushing of blood in your ears.  Your muscles slowly relax as your breathing normalizes and the forest ambiance fades back in.  The smoke parts around the stoic face of the Caterpillar, still watching you intently.  He scrutinizes you carefully, then at last gives a satisfied nod and long exhale of smoke.  \"You have found yourself, then,\" he states drolly, returning to his reclining position.  \"When you change now, it will be for the better.\"  You don't know what the Caterpillar expected, but you weren't prepared for this sort of introspective crisis.  Were you still yourself?  Was this all to spark some future change in you?  Or was it preventing a change by making you conscious of it now?  You rise with the intention of pressing the Caterpillar on what he just did to you, but to your surprise he has vanished completely back into the smoke.  You wait tensely, but in vain as even the exotic scent that led you to the Caterpillar fades away.  All you can do now is continue on your search through Wonderland, a little warier if nothing else."

You scowl in annoyance and prepare to give the Caterpillar a good talking to, but you stop mid-breath.  As the insect bitterly puffs on the hookah, shadows from the surrounding glade begin to collect inside him.  With each inhalation, he grows larger and more alien.  His scowling face grows feral, and he gnaws on the pipe the more it changes.  You take several steps back from the Caterpillar as he draws upward in a predatory stance.\nRemembering the mushroom, you quickly devour the second piece he gave you, growing back to your normal size just ahead of the Caterpillar's own transformation.  The monster does not stop swelling, however, and you flee the smoky glade as trees splinter and fall behind you.  You focus on the mad dash ahead, still unable to see ahead more than a few yards, but spurred onward by the sound of cracking timber and scuttling of a dozen insect legs.  Something lashes out at you, barely missing your side and forcing you to veer off and slide down a mossy slope.  You barely keep your balance and crawl into a hollow log for respite.  Moments stretch to minutes, but the sounds of the mutated Caterpillar have vanished completely into the surrounding haze.  You wait in shaken silence for a few minutes more before finally crawling back out warily."

They glance at you lazily but do not rise from their seats, only sighing wistfully.\nAn awful commotion sounds dully through the door, although the two footmen seem not to hear it.  \"If you've more messages, you'll simply have to wait,\" the frog footman croaks at you, \"we've been waiting for weeks and we still can't get in.\"  You ask if the door is locked.  \"No,\" the fish footman burbles, \"but it's a footman's job to let people in, and if we're not inside, well...\"  The two footmen sigh a second time and go back to staring up at the sky dumbly.  You give the footmen a nominal thanks and open the door for yourself.\nThe inside of the manor is utterly chaotic.  Toppled furniture and display pieces litter the floors, and the wallpaper has been shredded systematically.  Each step brings you closer to the source of the noise, which you can only guess is a monster of some kind by the shrieking, clanging and scrambling you hear emitting from the kitchen.  Determined not to be caught by another of Wonderland's surprises, you ready yourself for a fight before you enter.\nYou burst through the kitchen door just in time to dodge a thrown piece of crockery.  A woman in the regal attire of a duchess stands beside her cook, both of them staring down an enormous shadowy boar, but both also looking more annoyed than frightened.  The Duchess scolds the monster severely and hurls pots and pans while her Cook does the bulk of the fighting with any utensils at hand.\n\"You'll catch a beating yet!\" the Duchess shrieks as she grabs for more dishes.  The Cook hurls a butcher's cleaver at the boar, who swats it out of the air with a feral cry.  \"Pepper!  The air must be thick with pepper!\" the brutish noblewoman clangs two ladles together as she calls again and again for pepper.  The Cook staves off the monster with a carving knife as she joins in the calls for pepper.  As you prepare to take action, you spy a lone pepper grinder sitting atop the counter next to you."

The handle whirls around easily, grinding the peppercorns and sending out a cloud of spice far denser than you expected.  Seconds later, the entire kitchen is blanketed with pepper.  You hold your nose, but the sneezes escape you all the same.  The shadowy boar joins you in wild sneezing while the Duchess and Cook, who are completely unaffected, cheer, still hurling dishes at the beast.  You can't make out a thing, but you can tell that the sneezes of the beast are growing more and more frenzied, until a single mighty expulsion clears the room of pepper, along with a fading shadow creature.\nIn the spot where the monster once stood, a baby with pig-like features lies in a bundle of cloth.  It wails loudly, still sneezing as the Duchess prances over to pick him back up.  \"There!  That will teach you to throw a tantrum just to annoy us!\"  You lower your weapons and scratch the back of your head in confusion, but the Duchess is completely delighted and the Cook has returned to preparing some unappealing soup.  \"Come now, sing with us, dear!  Speak roughly to your little boy, and beat him when he sneezes...\""

From what little the Duchess and her Cook say coherently, you realize that the boar monster was once the Duchess' son, and was somehow transformed into the frightening creature you just drove away.  No explanation you give placates the crazed duo in the slightest.  You beat a hasty retreat to the relative safety of the manor's hallway as you dodge the debris.

You study the paper for several minutes wondering just what the message is trying to convey.  Some of the words you recognize based on your recent experiences, while others hint at challenges and dangers you have yet to brave.  You carefully discount the out of place words until the remaining ones begin to make sense as directions.

A simple dirt lane cuts a surprisingly direct path through the countryside.  You follow it with anticipation building inside you as the dusty earth transitions to loose gravel and finally orderly cobblestones.  You scarcely have time to hope for any sort of relief before you arrive at the outskirts of a derelict village.\nIt's clear that Gurathnaka's minions have ripped this town apart.  Each stone wall bears the same deep gouges that you have seen from other sites of their attacks.  You watch each darkened corner of the village as you walk further into its heart.  As you near the center of the small town, the sounds of commotion grow steadily louder.  You peer around a corner cautiously and gawk at the sight coming from the village square.\nA lion and a unicorn, standing on two legs each and back to back, are fending off an advancing crowd of shadowy beasts.  You watch in amazement for several moments as the two expertly combat the dark creatures.  However, as the din of combat begins to fade to ambiance, you begin to catch smatterings of conversation from the pair of animals.\n\"You're slacking!  Positively slacking against these fiends!\" the Unicorn calls out from amid the melee, \"you're going to make us miss the refreshments!\"\n\"Your complaining slows you!\" the Lion retorts with a growl, \"I fight twice as hard as you ever could!\"  The two continue their brawl, glancing with irritation at each other whenever they can spare a glance.  You consider that the two may have once been rivals before being forced into fighting the shadows together.  With each passing second, each works to deliberately put the other at a disadvantage.  Their wider swings clip each other, their poor footing trips the other, and their exchanges grow more and more volatile.  At the rate that they're destroying their own fighting chances, you have only a small window to act."

You bark orders at them to shape up and focus on their foes, and while the rivals don't respond verbally, they obey to keep the fight going.\nYou've never seen this many of the shadows attacking the same spot at once.  Their relentless assault doesn't give you an opportunity to consider anything but staying alive, however.  Monster after monster hurl themselves at you, clawing and biting savagely, but repelled time and time again.  For minutes, the melee drags on until at last the flow of enemies evaporates.  You stand raggedly, as do the Lion and the Unicorn, utterly exhausted and not a bit bruised from the attacks.\n\"Plum cake!\" the Lion calls out, and the Unicorn echoes his strange demand, \"this sort of fight deserves a king's refreshment!\"  You don't have anything to offer the duo, though you do pose them several questions.\n\"You may have fought well, but don't think you're anywhere near our mark!\" the Unicorn brags down to you, \"the crown must go to one of us two - me to be precise.\"  The Lion scoffs and attempts to rebuff the claim, but you ignore his grumbling.  You explain that whatever crown they're fighting for is nowhere to be found.\n\"The blackguards!\" the Lion snorts, \"stolen our - my - crown while they ruined our sport!\"  The Unicorn stamps its hooves in half agreement, calling for the crown.  \"We'll retake the crown and then fight for it once again!  See that we don't!\"  You decide not to raise any further objections as long as they've settled on working together against the shadows.

They utter fatalistic words about you and your quest, and of the ever-growing hunger of Gurathnaka.  You hurry forward, doing your best to ignore the disturbing plants.\nThe overgrown garden finally opens around the base of a lone tree, under which an equally solitary figure paces.  The silhouette of a chess queen is unmistakable in the pale woman who mumbles to herself in a steady drone.  You approach, but she turns towards you with a distant smile before you even think to call for her attention.  \"Ah, you arrive at last!  I remembered that we would meet here.\"  You wrinkle your brow at the statement, only causing the queen to chuckle lightly.  \"And I recalled that expression of yours as well.  But it is no simple task, remembering the future.  Especially memories of such a dark and dismal future as yours.\"  She stares at you - almost as though staring through you - and you find her eyes pale and cloudy with a dark emptiness gnawing inward from the rims.  The White Queen's smile grows forlorn as she continues her stare.  \"Would you like to hear your future history?\""

The queen's voice echoes from all around you as you observe each of the figures, which morph and reform to reflect your thoughts.  \"Memories are strange things, you know.  Each person recalls them differently.\"  The nearest cloud takes on your own appearance, and the others drift towards it, forming a strange tableau.

Each echoing sound might be some eerie creature stalking your steps, or another of Gurathnaka's shadows hungering for your essence.  Your worries escalate as the clear path you'd been following dead-ends in a bramble patch.  You scan the tangle for any sign of a way through or around, but without any promise.  Your eyes return to the path you arrived by, only to find that the forest has swallowed it without any trace.  It's almost as if the woods themselves were actively working to confuse you, like many of Wonderland's other denizens.  Now at a loss for direction, you stumble forward through the rough terrain as long as the fading light allows.  Each passing moment gradually amplifies your fear of being ambushed out from the darkness.  You press on until finally, at the foot of a gnarled tree, you make a campfire from the fallen branches to wait out the night.\nNot an hour into your rest, you are awoken by the clanging of a bell and the clamor of nearby voices.  You rouse yourself from sleep and find that your campfire is somehow missing, though a purring chuckle directs your attention above your head.  The Cheshire Cat holds the burning logs in two paws, waving them like signal lanterns.  Noticing that you've awoken, the cat grins and sets the fire back down before disappearing once more.  A crowd of ten figures rushes eagerly into the clearing around the tree, only to stop with groans and sighs.  \"Tisn't a Snark at all!\" a proud looking man cries, waving his bell for attention.  \"Though Snarks are handy for striking a light, this one's been lit by someone or other.\"  The hunters seat themselves around your fire with several shows of exhaustion.  \"At least it wasn't a Boojum...\" a man with a baker's hat mutters as he wipes the sweat from his brow thankfully.\n\"We'd all have vanished away were that the case!\" the Bellman retorts, seating himself beside you.  He looks you over for a moment as if just noticing you and stands once more.  \"By chance, would you also be hunting a Snark?\"  You shake your head and explain that you've gotten lost in the woods here.  \"What luck, we're lost as well!\" he exclaims with a smile, \"but a Snark's the cure for that!  A Snark is useful for a great many things, and finding one's way surely might be one of them.  You're quite welcome to join our search... pending your profession.\"  You look to the hunters and see a banker, a butcher, a beaver, and others all with jobs beginning with \"b.\"  You think for a moment and tell the Bellman that you could be considered a bodyguard, and he leads his fellows in a cheer.  \"Just what we chiefly need!  We'll find the Snark in no time at all now!  The Tulgey Wood may be dense as a dunce and thicker than thieves, but we'll find the Snark in spite of it!\""

The echoes of the other hunters gradually reaching their own untimely ends reverberates between the trees.  Each short series of shouts and shrieks inevitably ends in a sudden silence.  The distant sound of the Bellman's ringing is the last thing to fade into the night, bringing an end to the disastrous expedition.\nYou take only a few steps more before a rushing sound of air builds behind you.  You turn in dread to see a blanket of darkness sweeping over the forest, extinguishing every speck of light in its path.  Not wanting to strain your luck any further, you break into a sprint.  Your own lights flicker and begin to fade as you keep just ahead of the advancing wave.  Step by step you maneuver over the rough terrain, daring not look back again, until a ray of morning sun blinds you suddenly.  You collapse down in confusion and exhaustion, expecting the worst, but the wave of darkness has receded once again."

Three cheers for the Bodyguard who first laid hands on the beast!\"  The hunters cheer and call for a celebratory feast, but with only the Snark available to cook, they agree it would be a terrible waste.\nThe Snark in the meantime sits quietly in the center of the group.  The many purported uses for the beast seem beyond its capabilities, but for its ability to lead you safely out of the woods.  The Snark - and you by extension - must know every inch of these woods by now, for all that you covered during the chase.  For minutes at a time, it studies each of the hunters in turn before directing its attention back at you.  The creature is observant, another quality that no doubt helped it stay out of harm's way until recently.  You stare into the Snark's eyes, and you lock for several seconds before it speaks to you in perfect English.  \"I've been told it's rude to stare.\""

Cult activity has increased in Iceland over the past six months with the rise of the \"Disciples of Egil,\" a group that worships one Egil Skallagrímsson, the violent warrior poet and anti-hero of the Icelandic sagas. This strikes you as odd, that a thousand year-old literary character would be the focal point of a cult, and a poet, no less. The more you read of his exploits, the less you seem to understand who he really was. While he solved most of his problems with his blade, he also escaped trouble through his epic poetry. Despite being an abnormally ugly and monstrous figure with both troll and giant lineage, his extreme emotional outbursts bely a depth of character uncommon in 10th century sagas. Most of the country had accepted Egil as a transitional symbol of the country moving on from their heathen past before conversion to Christianity at the end of the 10th century.\nIn any case, his followers have been spreading chaos in Reykjavik in traditional Viking fashion, leaving impaled horse heads on \"scorn poles\" as a warning to the city that Egil will return. Indeed, two weeks ago, one of the cultists loosed an \"arrow of war\" into the Parliament House declaring Egil the \"eternal lawspeaker of Iceland and the world at large.\" This winter, the country is preparing for the upcoming 1000th anniversary of the national parliament, the Althing, celebrating a millennium of independence. While local authorities may be content to chalk up this cultist activity to post-war, nationalist fervor, your contact at Miskatonic University, Dr. Agatha Crane, thinks the provenance could be paranormal. She has entrusted you to lead an expedition into the tundra of Iceland to get to the bottom of this mystery with the aid of her friend and former colleague, Professor Shirley Day Morris.\nYou see the idyllic coastline of Reykjavik rise into view along the horizon, and prepare to disembark."

This campaign originally began as a 3-part campaign, consisting of The Tatterdemalion, Electric Nightmare and Starfall, but I quickly realized, along with a few playtesters, that the setting and story was too interesting to leave so quickly.\nThe framework of Arkham Horror LCG is really a medium to tell stories in — and I knew that deep space sci-fi horror is a genre deeply connected to Lovecraftian themes and would have to be explored by custom scenarios eventually. I originally did not want to make it because it would have been very simple for a sci-fi themed campaign to stray in tone from the Arkham Files universe, but when I finally figured out a way to bring the investigators into the future that wasn't too ridiculous, and how to incorporate the mythos in a way that fits the universe without being too obvious, I just had to create the campaign. The King in Yellow is my favourite Ancient One, with the way it plays with psychological horror and perception of reality, with a certain theatrical flare, and the Path to Carcosa is my favourite campaign released so far, so it was only natural for a virtual reality-bending memory-involved campaign to become a loose sequel to the Path to Carcosa. Hastur is not the Ancient One most would associate with deep space, which is precisely why it fits so well.\nI hope this campaign satisfies the need for a deep space sci-fi campaign. I tried to incorporate as many sci-fi tropes that are to be expected from a \"sci-fi\" campaign organically as possible while keeping the tone and writing style of FFG's stories. I do hope more people will explore the story space of sci-fi with the Arkham framework, perhaps even further in the future than I have, maybe something closer to a space-opera? Or even a pure adaptation of the Alien series. But for now, that will be it from me in this grim future setting.\nAnyways, I do hope you all enjoyed this campaign. Alas, it's time to work on the next one, whenever I have free time, in these <i>dark ages</i>."

An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\nTo have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\nFinding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\nThe lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep."

My directive is to store and manage the information archives on the ship.\" She hastily explains that a few of her classmates and her were kidnapped from their school by the 'bad people' on January 16th, 2045. Their brains were surgically removed and preserved in a special experimental machine that eventually became the powerful supercomputer operating the Tatterdemalion, K2-PS187.\nAs you walk through the town, it becomes clear that something horrible has happened here. Everything appears to be in disarray, as if a riot has recently passed through. Freshly-painted yellow graffiti depicting strange symbols and hieroglyphs can be seen. Everywhere are splatters of blood, spent shell casings, and pale face masks. There are no bodies, but you can hear the sound of distant screams, gunshots, and sirens coming from beyond the streets. Nearby is an overturned police car and a black box truck lying on its side. Huge claw marks have torn into the metal of the truck and its rear doors hang open. As you walk past, a radio from within crackles and sputters, then blares, “Hello, Unit 12? Unit 12, is that you? Please respond.\" Maja clarifies that this virtual environment that represents K2-PS187's dreams takes the form of the day they got captured, the day the entire world ended. What could possibly have happened on Earth in the distant future? Or rather, the distant past?\nYou finally arrive outside of a large brick building. Maja halts and gestures towards it. \"This is where my friends are hiding. The bad people made us translate a scary story and make a movie for them. We didn't want to read it, but they made us. A few days later, Annie, the universal translator, she — she —\" Maja struggles to utter the words. There is a desperate fear in her eyes. \"You won't believe me, but I swear, it was the Boogeyman! I saw the Boogeyman eat her! I ran away and searched the archives to see if anything, anyone could help. After a long time, I finally found someone and called out to them. That's when you woke up! Now that you're inside our system, you can save us!\"\nBefore you is a path leading to a pair of double doors, above which are the words “Public School 187.” Underneath, someone has written “HASTUR RISES!” in yellow spray paint. An inhuman howl echoes through the halls inside the school, followed by children screaming in terror."

The quantum artifact's hue shifts into a yellow glare before glowing an intense and dense red. The discs spin around and around the surface at different, but consistent speeds, until they finally slow down to a crawl and fall over simultaneously. Then, as suddenly as it began, the red shard erupts in a fog of nebulous gas, blinding you in its flurry.\nWhen your eyesight returns, all that remains are the golden discs resting at various locations across the floor. You instinctively recognize this as a schematic of the solar system. Upon closer examination, a single remnant of the purple shard remains between what you believe is Jupiter and Saturn's orbits. K2-PS187 confirms that the depiction is accurate to the current star-time — and begins plotting a course towards the asteroid.\nOn the way there, you think of the different worlds you have visited and many adventures you have experienced, both in this world and in your own. Throughout every interaction, every quest, is the underlying sense of hope and optimism for the future. This future does not deserve to become another pawn to the mad king, and you intend to stop that from happening.\nWhen you arrive, the asteroid does not resemble what you had expected. The egg-shaped asteroid is about 4 km at its widest, and looks awfully… normal. The yellow color is closer to a murky brown than gold. It is littered with craters and cavities, battered by the harshness of space. Without delay, you suit on and descend onto the surface of Fragment, ready to face the Royal Princess of Carcosa…"

The two completed vessels set out for Mars, each carrying 3000 humans in suspended animation. One vessel, the Liberty, suffered a massive power plant failure and the crew and passengers were killed. The other ship, Hope, eventually reached Mars…\"\n<right>— Maja, Information Archives</right>\nThe planet Earth — what used to be humanity's sanctuary, is now abandoned to the madness of the Ancient Ones. There is very little information of what remains on the Earth, but if anyone would attempt to send out a transmission, survey vessels stationed around the planet such as the Nostalgia II would hear those calls.\nThe trip itself was uneventful, and you spend your days watching the blue dot of Earth grow and grow in size. Around the time you can finally recognize a few of the continents, the Tatterdemalion picks up a lonely and distant beat — the echo of the Nostalgia II's distress beacon. You try to hail the crew with your radios, but there is no response. The Tatterdemalion begins its deceleration, and with no time to waste, you prepare to board the godforsaken ship."

[…] The United Colonial Coalition is composed of twenty colonies, varying widely in size, population, and purpose. Some colonies exist solely for mining, while others focus on scientific research or are engineering centers; these usually have fewer than 200 individuals living within them. Other asteroids serve as population centers, containing vast hydroponic farms, universities, and recreational areas. These can be home to more than a thousand colonists…\"\n<right>- Maja, Information Archives</right>\nWhen you arrive at the asteroid, you are absorbed by the fuchsia glow of Elbrus. Quantum materials have only recently been discovered, but may hold key properties that could be used to engineer devices that would have been impossible with classical materials. Unfortunately, quantum fields generated by these materials disrupt traditional radio communication, making it impossible for you to hail the scientists on Elbrus. Without further ado, you and your companions board one of the landing crafts and drift towards the asteroid…\nThe purple aurora spreads over the viewport like distant milk, filling the room with an electric tinge. Your final approach vector takes you directly over one of the larger craters on the asteroid. The computer calculates the trajectories, and commences the final descent onto the rocky surface. It is just then that the short-range radios crackle into a man's terrified voice. \"Abort the landing procedure now! Abort! Before —\" But it is too late. The warning lights begin flashing on and off as the craft spins out of control. You grab onto anything you can, but the vessel increasingly spins and spins until your arms flail and darkness prevails…"

The cultists recently undertook a mission to free Tassilda, daughter of Hastur, rumored to be imprisoned on an asteroid codenamed Fragment. The ship managed to rendezvous with Fragment and deployed several survey teams to search the caverns upon it. Before your current mind was implanted, you were one of these cultist explorers, destined to awaken Tassilda.\nAfter a few weeks of survey, one of the teams retrieved a slab of alien hieroglyphs, and ordered K2-PS187 to begin a translation. Another team reported to have found the inner chambers where Tassilda resided and destroyed the imprisoning sigils. They were never heard from again.\nYou and your fellow cultists swiftly withdrew from the asteroid before the princess of Carcosa could awaken and attack the Tatterdemalion. Content that such were the risks one took worshipping gods of pure chaos, you did not mourn your lost companions. The ship was set to return to the inner solar system. Your mission has been a success. You had finally freed Tassilda, the daughter of Hastur, who might soon be elevated by her father to become a new Ancient One.\nWhile most of the cultists entered cryosleep for the journey home, K2-PS187 was busy analysing the alien runes. When the translation was complete, the computer learned of a story titled \"Heir to Carcosa.\" The knowledge caused it to go insane and slaughter all of the waking crew out of terror. The ship was left in turmoil, drifting without sense through space — until K2-PS187 brought you back into this world from the archives in a final cry for help.\nYou now understand what you must do. Although Earth is no longer the home it used to be, humanity still exists, spread out throughout colonies in the solar system, living in fear and in isolation. If the being named Tassilda, Heir to Carcosa, would be exalted by her father, there is no doubt that she will decide to reign over humanity's colonies with the madness of Carcosa. You must atone for your past sins and eliminate the entity before she can be elevated to godhood. Unfortunately, the last recorded positions of Fragment were among the data lost during the initial corruption. However, K2-PS187 was able to retrieve a few leads from the ship's itinerary. You will need to traverse the solar system to locate the coordinates of the asteroid and prevent Tassilda's ascension."

For the next three hours, you witness a horrifying creative work, full of betrayal, intrigue, and horror. The story unfolds thus:</center>\n<center>After claiming Yhtill and absorbing it into Carcosa, the King in Yellow took the insane princess Camilla as a consort. Before her death, the princess bore the Ancient One three children, who became fosterlings of Hastur. They were two boys, named Thothut and Tasylock, and a girl named Tassilda. While normal-seeming at first, the children developed many of the physical characteristics and powers of their father. This transformation was viewed by their mother as yet another of Carcosa’s many corruptions. It was the final blow to Camilla’s mind, causing her heart to stop from despair and grief.</center>\n<center>For some time the royal trio lived with their sire in Carcosa, evil beings serving loyally at the foot of their father. But soon, like their mother, uncle, and grandmother before them, the princes and princess of Carcosa began to whisper, squabble, and plot. They had dreams of power and succession. Eventually Thothut and Tasylock unwisely moved against their father. Hastur was aware of the plot all along, and easily avoided their traps. In a way too horrible to describe, he destroyed both of his sons.</center>\n<center>His daughter Tassilda, who knew of her siblings’ plot but refused to take part in it, was spared. But she had done nothing to warn her father, choosing to wait and see if their plot was successful before committing to a course of action. For her silent betrayal, Tassilda was punished. Her father, He Who Should Not Be Named, sealed her into her home, which the Ancient One tore free of Carcosa and hurled out into space. Her father claimed that in an inevitable time, she will be released, and granted all that she desires.</center>"

What is going on? Where are you? One moment, you were in the Ward Theatre, watching the tedious theatre performance, and the next, in a cryosleep chamber.\nCryosleep… Despite having never heard the word before, you instinctively know what this procedure must be. Your mind may not recollect, but your body has been through this cycle of freezing and thawing many times. The thought of being familiar with something so foreign to you disturbs you to the core.\nWhen the warmth eventually reaches your fingers, the glass window slides open and releases you into a dark, metallic room. The control panel next to your tomb delivers its computerized announcement: \"Welcome back aboard the Tatterdemalion. The current star date is April 4, 2147.\" You look out the nearest window, only to witness a black canvas of infinite stars and a colossal cerulean sphere — the planet Neptune. The thought of drifting through the infinite expanse of space does not frighten you, for you have lived your entire life in space — not in your past life in Arkham, but in the person you embody now.
