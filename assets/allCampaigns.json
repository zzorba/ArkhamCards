When you arrive, you find that the latches of his front door have been busted open, and his living area and study have been ransacked. Dr. Armitage is nowhere to be found. Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn’t steal tucked beneath several other documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage’s desk.\nThe journal appears to be written in a strange language you cannot decode, using a script you’ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it seems Dr. Armitage had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it belongs to one “Wilbur Whateley.” The journal—along with Armitage’s many notes—tells a startling tale, one you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier tonight…"

Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round it was bad news.

You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely remember anything else from that night.\nWhen you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst, you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find answers."

His face is pale, his forehead sweaty and wrinkled with worry.\nArmitage—the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours—privately contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You’d always known Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\nThe elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. “I am looking for two of my colleagues—Dr. Francis Morgan, professor of archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A very… <b>familiar</b> feeling.” You’ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. “I tried to find Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n“I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.”"

Joe took a few trinkets for himself, of course, but Curtis wanted nothing to do with it. Folk already didn’t trust him on account of his family’s sins, even though he’d been attending church on the regular and had stayed far away from anything resembling the arcane.\nEven so, Curtis could not shake a sense of foreboding. He’d seen the devastation that befell the Ericks, Bishop, and Frye homes. He’d even seen firsthand the creature the folks from Arkham had banished. Some days, his thoughts led him to Wilbur Whateley’s farm, where he would stand outside and stare for hours, too scared to enter, but too curious to leave. Maybe there was something in there that could make these terrible visions depart. Something that could give him strength enough to resist the nightmares. Curtis decided he would find it."

He was a good kid and a bit callow, but a hard worker and eager to prove himself. “This place was supposed to be cordoned off,” Gené responded. “Nobody’s lived here for months. And yet, see for yourself: their primitive rites continue to this day.”\nThe student approached and joined Gené in examining the sign, flipping through the pages of his journal to reference its symbols. “What do you think it means?” he asked. She shook her head. Outsiders rarely traveled to Dunwich, and all the signposts leading to the village had been taken down. But these days, even the townsfolk who had called this place home had abandoned it.\n“I don’t know,” Gené admitted. “But somebody is here, and this isn’t the first sign we’ve seen like this. Stories say there’s an altar where the townsfolk would conduct pagan rituals atop that hill. Maybe we’ll find more up there.”"

It cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and the people and creatures who attacked here in Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re certain now where you must head: the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\nYou consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax. Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy, and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further.\nYou pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning, you head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage’s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon Whateley who was present during the events several months ago.\nArmitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and unscrupulous, others “undecayed” or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the closest station and drive you into town\nAs the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and exhaustion sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise behind you…"

At first you imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a different picture.\nIt all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human."

Reading through these materials leaves you exhausted and emotionally drained. Most of the content was written by a single source—a man named Seth Bishop. When you ask around town, you learn that Seth is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident. Curiously, since that time, very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed his eyes had been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale.\nYou don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would appear nervous or paranoid. But the more you read of his frantic and unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events. His writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence” into other creatures, and eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow are unfathomably complex and defy understanding.\nBefore you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and women from the village approach you in a panic. “It’s back!” one of them wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch. “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the Bishops’ home like it were made o’ paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic."

The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below.\nFlocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you, watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck. As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature — <b>Yog‐Sothoth</b>.

Tempers are short, and in the last week alone there have been numerous reports of townspeople coming to heated, violent blows with one another over simple misunderstandings.\nAnd now, a call from James Hankerson. He claims to have found a dismembered body in his barn.\nBlaming the weather would be too easy. There is something wrong with this town, and not a whole lot this old soothsayer can do to stop the slide. My auguries indicate a small group of investigators will soon take note of these strange happenings and set forth to make things right.

This cult has been killing innocent people and feeding them to the ghouls, satiating a monstrous hunger. A dark balance was maintained. Until now. Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot fathom what to expect.\n“Many of the cultists,” Lita continues, “will seem like everyday people, despite their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.”"

However, a surprising detail also turns up: the one who invaded the lair and set this night’s events in motion was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this important detail was omitted from Lita’s story—did she tell you only as much as was necessary to draw you into her conflict? But in another light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city of Arkham from a terrible menace.\nThe final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by one of the cultists. It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within the woods south of Arkham, this very night. According to the journal, the ritual’s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult’s dark master into this world. “If the cult is not stopped,” Lita warns, “there is a possibility that Umôrdhoth’s vengeance will consume all in its path.” Frightened but determined to stop the ritual, you head into the woods…"

It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail... And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\nYou’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

Either the trail has gone cold, or they’re no longer in Arkham. Perhaps Daniel truly was insane, and you are only following him deeper down the rabbit hole.

You push these gloomy thoughts to the back of your mind and knock on Mr. Engram’s door. A flock of magpies scatters from the rooftop at the sudden noise. Then, to your surprise, the door opens.\nAcross the threshold of the doorway stands a tall man with a thick, brown mustache. A familiar silver-handled cane leans against the wall next to his coat hanger. “So it’s you,” he says. “Come in. I have expected you for some time now.” He turns away and walks toward his kitchen. You can hear a teapot whistling, as though he’d been preparing for your arrival.\nYou enter his home, unsure of what to do next. This gentle, unassuming man is not quite what you had expected.

You shake your head in response, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He paces back and forth around the room as he speaks rapidly. “He told me that you would be arriving soon. That I should... Prepare.” Nigel turns toward you as he reaches the wooden door across from you, his eyes flashing. “Don’t worry. All is ready. The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret his cryptic comments. You wait a few minutes for him to return, but when he does not, you begin to worry. Then you notice that mold has already begun to grow over the cheese he’d brought you. “Mr. Engram?” you call out, and you hesitantly knock on the door to his study. There is no response. When you enter the room, you find him hanging from the ceiling fan, his body rotting from weeks of decomposition.",

Only this tale is one of horrors and madness. During low tide, you would be able to reach the island on foot by crossing the tidal causeway that emerges from the sea. However, by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much higher than you’d anticipated. Dark clouds cover the sky, and a distant crash of thunder signals the start of the oncoming storm. You find a boat whose captain is willing to take you to the island, and prepare for the ritual to come."

Your mind is a flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t staked a claim on, I tell you.”\nYou stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking. “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty— save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost.",

Bursting through the door, to the stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk sergeant, who is lazily working through a stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist, but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice. “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your back as he escorts you out of the station.\nYou <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue.

Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior looks the same as it did when you arrived to see The King in Yellow earlier that night. You walk to the front window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\nJust then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\nHis unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out.

What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of The King in Yellow was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed by the same man: Nigel Engram.\nThere is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occuring within the city: the Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of The King in Yellow, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the questions that burn in your mind."

It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”\nHours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts, mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that he has been choked to death."

His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n<center><fancy>*Carcosa is real\nDo not let them open the path</fancy></center>\nWhen Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:<center><fancy>Hastur is the king in tatters\nlocked in his prison in the stars\nseal him away and stop this madness!</fancy></center>\nYour mind swims with questions.

Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling upon the steering wheel."

From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off toward Southside, full of grim determination."

An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\nTo have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming...and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\nFinding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\nThe lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting...drifting...to sleep."

The role of Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\nJust then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away— his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black."

You recognize a few of the faces as he flips through the pages. “Daniel... Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of Doctor Mintz. But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.” You argue and insist to be let into the patient wing, knowing that Daniel must hold the key to understanding what is really going on.\nThe receptionist gives a pitying smile and relents, nodding to the security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of course,” he says with all the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you with Doctor Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel.

Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn’t steal tucked beneath several other documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage’s desk.\nThe journal appears to be written in a strange language you cannot decode, using a script you’ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it seems Dr. Armitage had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it belongs to one “Wilbur Whateley.” The journal—along with Armitage’s many notes—tells a startling tale, one you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier tonight…"

His face is pale, his forehead sweaty and wrinkled with worry.\nArmitage—the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours—privately contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You’d always known Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\nThe elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. “I am looking for two of my colleagues—Dr. Francis Morgan, professor of archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A very… <b>familiar</b> feeling.” You’ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. “I tried to find Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n“I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.”"

Joe took a few trinkets for himself, of course, but Curtis wanted nothing to do with it. Folk already didn’t trust him on account of his family’s sins, even though he’d been attending church on the regular and had stayed far away from anything resembling the arcane.\nEven so, Curtis could not shake a sense of foreboding. He’d seen the devastation that befell the Ericks, Bishop, and Frye homes. He’d even seen firsthand the creature the folks from Arkham had banished. Some days, his thoughts led him to Wilbur Whateley’s farm, where he would stand outside and stare for hours, too scared to enter, but too curious to leave. Maybe there was something in there that could make these terrible visions depart. Something that could give him strength enough to resist the nightmares. Curtis decided he would find it."

He was a good kid and a bit callow, but a hard worker and eager to prove himself. “This place was supposed to be cordoned off,” Gené responded. “Nobody’s lived here for months. And yet, see for yourself: their primitive rites continue to this day.”\nThe student approached and joined Gené in examining the sign, flipping through the pages of his journal to reference its symbols. “What do you think it means?” he asked. She shook her head. Outsiders rarely traveled to Dunwich, and all the signposts leading to the village had been taken down. But these days, even the townsfolk who had called this place home had abandoned it.\n“I don’t know,” Gené admitted. “But somebody is here, and this isn’t the first sign we’ve seen like this. Stories say there’s an altar where the townsfolk would conduct pagan rituals atop that hill. Maybe we’ll find more up there.”"

It cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and the people and creatures who attacked here in Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re certain now where you must head: the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\nYou consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax. Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy, and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further.\nYou pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning, you head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage’s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon Whateley who was present during the events several months ago.\nArmitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and unscrupulous, others “undecayed” or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the closest station and drive you into town\nAs the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and exhaustion sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise behind you…"

You are in an unfathomable place, vast beyond your ability to reason and utterly alien besides. The landscape is surreal and strange, the architecture impossible. You are so far from home that home has become a threadbare dream you can barely recall. Even should you find a way out of this awful place, you may never be the same again."

At first you imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a different picture.\nIt all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human."

      "text": "Your search of the village of Dunwich has uncovered a number of documents, journal entries, and esoteric theories. Reading through these materials leaves you exhausted and emotionally drained. Most of the content was written by a single source—a man named Seth Bishop. When you ask around town, you learn that Seth is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident. Curiously, since that time, very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed his eyes had been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale.\nYou don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would appear nervous or paranoid. But the more you read of his frantic and unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events. His writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence” into other creatures, and eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow are unfathomably complex and defy understanding.\nBefore you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and women from the village approach you in a panic. “It’s back!” one of them wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch. “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the Bishops’ home like it were made o’ paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic."

The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of satanic rites being performed there—rites in which great ritual-pyres light up the night sky while the ground rumbles furiously below.\nFlocks of whippoorwills perch on the rooftops of the village around you, watching ominously as you climb inside Zebulon’s old and beat-up truck. As you drive towards Sentinel Hill, more screeching fills the sky with an awful pitch that is painful to your ears. Everything you have read about and experienced in Dunwich has led to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature — <b>Yog‐Sothoth</b>. Failing to stop this ritual may spell doom...not only Dunwich, but for the entire world."

Some Bishop fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before he can explain further, the all-too-familiar ratta‐tat of a tommy gun echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny.

A silent, unspoken anger grips the town. Tempers are short, and in the last week alone there have been numerous reports of townspeople coming to heated, violent blows with one another over simple misunderstandings.\nAnd now, a call from James Hankerson. He claims to have found a dismembered body in his barn.\nBlaming the weather would be too easy. There is something wrong with this town, and not a whole lot this old soothsayer can do to stop the slide. My auguries indicate a small group of investigators will soon take note of these strange happenings and set forth to make things right. I’ll be watching their progress… but I won’t be holding my breath."

Your findings are disturbing: they claim to worship a being known as Umôrdhoth, a monstrous entity from another realm.\nYou are able to confirm much of Lita’s story: the cult is agitated over the destruction of a ghoul lair. However, a surprising detail also turns up: the one who invaded the lair and set this night’s events in motion was none other than Lita Chantler herself! You are not sure why this important detail was omitted from Lita’s story—did she tell you only as much as was necessary to draw you into her conflict? But in another light, she seems to be fighting to protect the city of Arkham from a terrible menace.\nThe final piece of the puzzle was found written in a journal possessed by one of the cultists. It describes a dark ritual to be performed deep within the woods south of Arkham, this very night. According to the journal, the ritual’s completion will open a gate and bring forth the cult’s dark master into this world. “If the cult is not stopped,” Lita warns, “there is a possibility that Umôrdhoth’s vengeance will consume all in its path.” Frightened but determined to stop the ritual, you head into the woods…"

Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot fathom what to expect.\n“Many of the cultists,” Lita continues, “will seem like everyday people, despite their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.”"

Daniel is a loose cannon, dazed and unresponsive one moment, and screaming for his life the next. It takes several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally, during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “The King in Yellow, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me. But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do, speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one The King in Yellow rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the Stranger discovers our plan!”\nHours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts, mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that he has been choked to death."

His eyes are bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of The King in Yellow in his stiff hands. You pry the playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page, mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n<center><fancy>*Carcosa is real\nDo not let them open the path</fancy></center>\nWhen Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:<center><fancy>Hastur is the king in tatters\nlocked in his prison in the stars\nseal him away and stop this madness!</fancy></center>\nYour mind swims with questions. How did he escape the asylum? How did he die? And why does he appear human to your eyes now? With little time to spare, you clean the room of your belongings and flee.

An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\nTo have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so unassuming...and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\nFinding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\nThe lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of The King in Yellow is a tedious bore. The setting and characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding The King in Yellow aren’t connected, after all. Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide, however, you find yourself drifting...drifting...to sleep."

You couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions on many of the audience members’ faces, and you wonder how the audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of Cassilda is tiresomely boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\nJust then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all. Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away— his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black."

What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing your investigation, but the truth calls out to you, and you cannot help but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange happenings surrounding The King in Yellow. Another group of investigators had been researching these events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum, ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you. Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail... And all the more certain that you should stop while you still have the chance.\nYou’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of The King in Yellow, and discovered several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires."

You push these gloomy thoughts to the back of your mind and knock on Mr. Engram’s door. A flock of magpies scatters from the rooftop at the sudden noise.

A familiar silver-handled cane leans against the wall next to his coat hanger. “So it’s you,” he says. “Come in. I have expected you for some time now.” He turns away and walks toward his kitchen. You can hear a teapot whistling, as though he’d been preparing for your arrival.\nYou enter his home, unsure of what to do next. This gentle, unassuming man is not quite what you had expected. Nigel’s home is a mess of notes, old books, and strange diagrams. Covering the coffee table in his living room is an old, faded map, bearing many fold creases and tattered edges. It looks to be an incomplete map of the catacombs beneath Paris, or at least a section of it. Mr. Engram returns moments later with hot tea and a plate of cheese and crackers. “I assume you are here to find the path to Carcosa?” he asks, wearing an excited grin. You shake your head in response, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He paces back and forth around the room as he speaks rapidly. “He told me that you would be arriving soon. That I should... Prepare.” Nigel turns toward you as he reaches the wooden door across from you, his eyes flashing. “Don’t worry. All is ready. The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret his cryptic comments. You wait a few minutes for him to return, but when he does not, you begin to worry. Then you notice that mold has already begun to grow over the cheese he’d brought you. “Mr. Engram?” you call out, and you hesitantly knock on the door to his study. There is no response. When you enter the room, you find him hanging from the ceiling fan, his body rotting from weeks of decomposition.",

However, by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much higher than you’d anticipated. Dark clouds cover the sky, and a distant crash of thunder signals the start of the oncoming storm. You find a boat whose captain is willing to take you to the island, and prepare for the ritual to come."

Below the earth the salt water seeps, the shadows fall as the red sun sleeps...” Studying the island that lies before you, illuminated by flashes of lighting and assaulted by tumultuous waves, you can’t help but wonder if Ashleigh was singing about this very moment."

Your mind is a flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t staked a claim on, I tell you.”\nYou stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking. “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty— save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost.",

Bursting through the door, to the stares of onlookers and police officers alike, you demand to see Sheriff Engle, stressing the importance of your visit. The desk sergeant, who is lazily working through a stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist, but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice. “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your back as he escorts you out of the station.\nYou <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to The King in Yellow cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your coat pocket, hoping it will lead you to the answers you seek.",

A small part of you wonders if this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget. Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior looks the same as it did when you arrived to see The King in Yellow earlier that night. You walk to the front window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\nJust then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\nHis unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who <b>are</b> you?” you call out.

Instead, you see nothing but the misty, starless night, and the deserted road behind you.\nYour thoughts once again wander, as they have often in the past few hours, to The King in Yellow and to the city of Carcosa and its inhabitants. What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of The King in Yellow was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed by the same man: Nigel Engram.\nThere is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occuring within the city: the Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of The King in Yellow, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the questions that burn in your mind."

The Historical Society may have kept records pertaining to this earlier production, especially if it was followed by events similar to what has occurred tonight.

Dawn breaks as you reach the boarding house, the front doorknob and ferns on the porch covered in dew. You are lucky enough to get a vacant room for the day, and soon you are fast asleep.\nSuddenly, you are falling. Above and all around you, a blinding radiance flares like an inferno. Your head twinges with pain and your vision swims with brilliant colors. Your skin is singed by the flames. Below you, the abyss opens and swallows you whole. You then find yourself in a dank, windowless cell, filled with a putrid stench. A man is huddled in a corner of the room, shivering from the cold, or from the hopelessness of his situation, or perhaps both. “No mask,” he mutters over and over, “no mask, no mask...” You take a few tentative steps forward, but before you can reach him, the metal slot on his cell door slides open, and you hear an orderly call to him. “Daniel, it’s time,” he says. “Daniel, wake up. Wake up, Daniel.” Then, you awaken.",

He points toward the staircase nearby and pushes you away from the catacombs. You stumble onto the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire and slowly make your way to a hotel where you can stay the night.\nSeveral days of research later, the meaning of the strange diagrams you saw within the catacombs still escapes you. You feel as though you have been led on a wild goose chase. Just as you are about to give up, you see a faded yellow book on the table nearest to you. You are stunned to discover that it is the unabridged script of The King in Yellow. Drawn on the cover in black ink is the very same diagram whose meaning you have been struggling to interpret for several sleepless nights. Who had placed it here? How had it come to your hotel room? Regardless, you know what you must do. The play holds the secrets—it has all along—and yet like a fool you have avoided reading Act II out of superstition. Its words cannot harm you any more than the creatures and fanatics you have already encountered. Trembling, you open to the second part, and begin to read.",

You have brought the skull to experts, occultists, and professors. You have even tried speaking with the skull on more than one occasion. Exasperated, you place the skull on your night table and try to get some sleep for the first time since escaping the catacombs. As you fall asleep, you cannot shake the sight of the diagram etched in the skull’s forehead.\nYou awaken with a spark of inspiration and rush to the Musée du Louvre, a famous Parisian museum housing tens of thousands of paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. You spend days exploring the museum—every display, every collection, every single object of art that might hold a clue to the diagram’s meaning. Finally, you see it: a painting depicting a beautiful island town weathering a torrential storm. Waves crash against the stone of the outer wall, the tide threatening to swallow the island whole. Lightning flashes around the tower of the abbey above the village. A whirlwind of black clouds churns in the sky above. The diagram from the burned skull you hold in your hands is recreated perfectly in the stained glass of the abbey. The title of the piece is “The Path Is Open.”",

Although you’d slept a healthy eight-and-a-half hours, you feel even more exhausted than you had the previous night. You catch a glimpse of your dark, bloodshot eyes in the mirror next to the dresser, and wonder if you’ve gotten any real sleep at all.\nWho is Daniel, you wonder? The chamber from your dream looked like a prison, but the man—Daniel—he seemed unhinged, as though he wasn’t in control of his mind. This led to only one conclusion: An asylum. Knowing you’ll get little rest here, you head towards Arkham Asylum, hoping your hunch is correct."

The rest of them—that is, those for whom you can find any records at all—disappeared or died soon after opening night in a variety of fashions connected only by their morbidness. Freak accidents. Suicides. Vanishings.\nIt would seem that Daniel is your only lead, if you are to investigate further. According to the records you found, he was admitted to Arkham Asylum many years ago. All documentation about Daniel’s treatment seems to end there. You’re unsure if he’s even still alive. Perhaps he was cured and released.

You recognize a few of the faces as he flips through the pages. “Daniel... Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of Doctor Mintz. But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.” You argue and insist to be let into the patient wing, knowing that Daniel must hold the key to understanding what is really going on.\nThe receptionist gives a pitying smile and relents, nodding to the security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of course,” he says with all the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you with Doctor Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel. These gentlemen will see you in.” Relieved that you will soon get the answers you seek, you are escorted into the patient wing of Arkham Asylum..."

This time, she draws the Low on Supplies treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Circuitous Trail that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action.

How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\nAlejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private.

When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet...I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean.

He’d said he had a job offer for me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect.\nHarlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers.\nAlejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this— or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along.\nThe way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer. Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."

Even more vast and terrifying are the endless depths below you, beyond the edges of stone chasms and archaic bridges. On all sides, this underground realm seems to extend beyond the boundary of your sight; you wonder just how far it reaches. Perhaps the entirety of the known surface of the Earth is but the top layer of another world..."

Perhaps I would rather these events had been a figment of my imagination.\nIn truth, I have no idea how we made it out of the caverns beneath the jungle alive. Simply reaching the abyssal place was a hellish ordeal. My memory of our return trip is muddled and disarrayed. We scrambled in the dark for what seemed like ages. We were out of food, out of supplies, out of hope—but somehow, we found a way out.\nOur reward for preventing calamity was scorn and ridicule. No upstanding paper or university would publish our findings, and of course we possessed no proof of our expedition save for our scars and nightmares. I wish I could say that my memory of these events has faded with each passing day, but I will never forget the alien city we explored in our conical bodies, the serpents that pursued us in red-litten Yoth, the formless abomination that lived in the depths of the Earth...\nPerhaps that is why I fear making a written account of our findings—because these memories will crystallize and become etched in my mind, forever damning me to a life of terror and dismay. Still, the world needs to know what we saw. What we did.",

The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\nIchtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\nCrossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\nPadma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs.\nOnce she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation..."

The glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples. Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air.\nRising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\nYour head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back.

The maw in the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\nIt is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing...Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her.

They are horrifying to look upon, but they do not harm you as you expected they might. Your first few days are spent restrained and questioned by the creatures, several of which are somehow able to communicate in English. Others reproduce your language using an odd futuristic machine, played like a musical instrument. You are reminded strangely of the jazz piano at the Nightingale. It is only then that you realize your body has been altered. You have no hands or fingers to play the keys, no legs to walk upon, no lungs to scream out. You are one of them now, one of the creatures that has taken you captive, and your original body is nowhere to be seen.\nDespite your captivity, the creatures do not seem intent on harming you. Instead, they merely interview you, asking all manner of questions about a broad range of topics: your society, your profession, your technology, your ecosystem, your human body. Their thirst for knowledge is unyielding, unending. Their questions range from the mundane to the complex. They implore you to write copiously in your own language, taking anything you write to store away in their vast archives. You are informed that you will be able to roam the city freely if you comply."

It seems more concerned with preventing you from harming your body than preventing you from escaping. After many days of captivity, you find a way to use this to your advantage. You struggle so hard against your restraints that they pierce into your leathery, cold flesh, drawing out a bit of viscous slime-blood. Your guard quickly apporoaches, clicking its claws together repeatedly. It undoes your restraints, and the moment it does, your claw appendages strike at what you believe to be the creature’s throat.

You push the nurse away and rise to your feet, suddenly puzzled and disoriented. Despite the nurse’s protests, you wobble feebly out of the room. You are in a hospital, its white halls smelling faintly of disinfectant and other chemicals. Just moments prior, hadn’t you been exploring some kind of underground cavern?... You cannot recall.\n“Excuse me? Come back, you must rest!” The nurse calls out to you, gripping your forearm and pulling you back to your cot. She examines you closely while you recover from the shock of being transported so far in so short a time. “Who is Alejandro?” she asks, and you struggle to recall. The name doesn’t ring a bell.\nYou ask the nurse how you came to be here, wondering why she isn’t surprised at your sudden appearance. “Why, you admitted yourself to St. Mary’s just last night. Do you not remember?” You have no memory of this, and you are starting to grow concerned. “You were acting a little strangely, if I may be so bold. And you spoke in a strange fashion, almost as if English weren’t your first language. But now I see that you probably just drank a little bit too much.” She notices your questioning expression and smiles. “Don’t worry. We get that kind of thing quite often these days, now that all the bars and pubs are on the up-and-up again.”\nYou examine your face in the mirror. You are tired and older than you remember. Something important lies on the very edge of your memory, fuzzy and blurred. It takes about a minute before the significance of the nurse’s last statement catches up to you. Turning back toward the nurse, you ask what year it is, terrified of the answer.\n“Why, 1934 of course. My, you must have had a heck of a night!” She chuckles.",

The elaborate stone architecture has been worn away by ages of abandonment, but you sense that there is a history here that runs deeper than you can even fathom. When you turn around to question Ichtaca, you notice a faint yellow glow in her eyes, her pupils narrowed and contracted. “Yoth...the last refuge of Valusia...” she quietly intones.\nJust then, a terrifying roar echoes throughout the cavern. The walls and floor shake with tremendous force, and the red glow that permeates the area brightens. A flood of hisses emerges from the tunnels all around you. Ichtaca walks to the edge of a nearby precipice and looks out over the vast depths. “He is here. I feel his presence. The Father of the Serpents...<b>Yig</b>.”"

Her heel clips a rock near the edge of the precipice, and she tumbles over the side of the ledge, her scream growing distant as she falls. You barely have time to recover from the shock of what just happened, as another colossal roar fills the cavern, and the ground shakes. You gather your belongings and continue your descent."

But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\nWe ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple. Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?"

I told Maria, the expedition’s naturalist, to take one of the trucks and wait beyond the northern edge of the rainforest. Our cartographer, José, is guarding the camp until we return.

In spite of the serpent creatures, we were able to reach a hidden passage that led deeper underground.\nIn the central chamber of these underground halls, we found our prize: a steel orb of unknown origin, gently humming and glowing with a dim blue light. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance, and we knew it could not have been made by the Aztecs.\nWith the artifact in tow, we fled the ruins. The building had started to crumble around us, as though the orb was the only thing keeping it standing. Had it been powering the ruins, like a battery?

I convinced two of the other members of the expedition, José and Andrea, to venture in after the others...But now I fear a terrible fate has befallen them, as well.\nThankfully, my gambit was worthwhile. While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\nIn the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device. The orb was made of an unnatural steel, attached delicately to its bronze frame. It pulsed with power in my hands and glowed with a dim blue light. Any fool could tell that it was not made by the Aztecs, but the other members of the expedition could not even begin to understand its true significance. The ruins started to crumble around me as I left, but it mattered not. The relic was all that mattered now.\nWith the artifact in tow, I returned to camp and told the others it was time to depart. Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. Now we are headed to Texas, where we will cross the border into the United States.\nIt is a shame what happened to the others. Their sacrifice will not be in vain.

José had brought some TNT from the trucks, and there was more than enough to level the damned place.\nThat night, we put on a hell of a fireworks show. The jungle protested. Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\nJosé was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\nWith the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\nMaria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City. Even now I do not feel safe: who could, after seeing what we have seen?\nTo hell with the Eztli and to hell with this forsaken place.",

We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.\nThe dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.\nAlready one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds."

He’s decided to stay at camp until further notice, disturbed as he is by their presence. I thought he would be excited to learn more about them, but I expect this discovery defies even his broad-minded theories. I suppose he has a right to be distrustful.

The rainforest was guarded. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger and hate. They hunted us relentlessly, wielding primitive weaponry and communicating in sharp hisses.\nPerhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. I thought Alejandro would be excited to learn more about them, but he shared our alarm. We managed to fend off and interrogate their leader, a warrior named Ichtaca. Before she fled, she warned us to not go near the ruins. Unfortunately for her, we refuse to go home empty-handed.\nWith Alejandro leading the way, we’ve cleared a route to what he believes is the main temple of the ruins. There is little time to rest.

Her piercing eyes trace your every move like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged. “Where is the relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain that it is safe, in good hands.

Their methods are secret and furtive, and their motives elude you still. However, one piece of vital information has come to light.\n“They seek a place known as the Nexus of N’kai,” Ichtaca claims. A map of Central America lies on the table before you, marked with the previous expedition’s trail. “I have heard of this place, but its exact location is not known to me.” Once again, your mysterious guide appears to know more than she lets on.\nWith no other leads to follow, you are left with no choice.

I seek only to preserve my own record of these events, for I do not wish the passage of time to erase them completely. After all, these are not my memories, but the memories of my other self: the self who ventured through time and space to save humanity.\nIt is difficult to explain how we did what we did. After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember.

You are in the deepest level of this subterranean realm now: the caverns Ichtaca referred to as “N’kai.” Nothing could have prepared you for the impervious murk that surrounds you on all sides, an inky darkness that none of your light sources can penetrate. You grope around in the darkness until you feel the jagged wall of the cavern and begin to follow it aimlessly, desperately hoping to find the way forward. A grim realization dawns on you: Even should you complete your task, you will surely never find a way back to the surface. The overwhelming darkness of the cavern fills you with a dread you have never before experienced. You cannot see your hands as you grope about in the darkness, nor can you tell if you are in a narrow tunnel or a vast open space. The ground beside you could extend for miles or abruptly become a bottomless cavern, and you would not be able to tell the difference unless you stepped there. Hours pass as you stumble in the dark, slowly, carefully, nervously. Every step could be your last."

Nobody was allowed to leave the town, and only those approved by the shadow government agency was allowed to enter. Those unfortunate few included high-ranking government agent, and a team of researchers from the nearby Miskatonic University, who were summoned to investigate the meteor itself. For the rest of the town's inhabitants, it was a strange occurence, nothing more… that is, until the meteor <i>hatched</i>.\nI saw it with my own eyes. When the anomaly emerged, the first thing it did was devour the team of researchers who have been sent to collect and study samples from the meteor. The next thing it did was devour their lab equipment. Then Ron Graham's tractor. Then his house, in its entirety. It continued to grow and spread, devouring everything in its path. I barely escaped with my life.\nWhen the army arrived, they thought they could kill it with bullets and shells. Everything they threw at the creature was devoured, one round after the next. Then it split into hundreds of smaller pieces of itself, and the army was quickly overwhelmed. While the battle raged on, myself and others back in town saw lights and shapes in the sky above. Something was up there, waiting. Biding time.\nThe quarantine still holds, and we're stuck in the middle of it. It won't be long before the anomaly has grown large enough to devour everything in Blackwater. And if that happens, who could possibly stop its rampage?"

He is carrying a stack of dirty dishes. In your hand is a glass of water. You don’t remember ordering it, nor do you remember how long you’ve been here. And where <i>is</i> here, exactly? You spin around in your chair and realize you’re in the restaurant of the Excelsior Hotel. A few other diners are present, catching an early dinner and minding their own business. The soft light of an autumn afternoon filters in through the windows, and the general din of activity can be heard from the lobby. You turn and briefly glance back at the waiter before reaching in your pocket and dropping a quarter on the table, heading for the lobby. Your legs feel like jelly. As you stumble out of the restaurant, other guests view you with concern. The security guard in the corner watches you like a hawk. You head over to the front desk, steadying yourself against it. The concierge approaches, but you recoil at the recognition of his face. The hotel is operating as if nothing happened. But that can’t be. Everything you saw was true, right? You dash out the front door before he can reach you. You have to put some distance between yourself and this accursed place.\nWeeks pass. Nothing helps to quell the feeling in your mind that you have missed something important. This business with the Excelsior is not done, not by a long shot. You begin your investigation anew, asking around town for the latest rumors regarding the hotel. More missing staff. More sudden closures. Guests who never arrived. Guests who <i>never</i> left. It’s all too much.\nStanding on a lonely street corner in Northside, you consider your options. Streetlamps flicker to life around you as evening creeps in. Just then, a stranger bumps into you, muttering a half-hearted apology. You take a step after them before you feel something tugging at the back of your mind. No. Could it be? You stick your hands into your coat pocket. Stuffed inside is a small, folded note. You look up, but the pedestrian is nowhere in sight. You unfold the note slowly, fingers shaking from anxiety and fear.\n<center><fancy>It’s all a facade.</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>Room 225.

What really happened in the Excelsior that night?\nJust then, you hear rapping on the bars of your cell. An officer stands just outside, looking away from you. He slips a folded note between the bars of your cell. Knowing better than to ask his intentions out loud, you slowly walk over and unfold the note, your fingers shaking with trepidation.\n<center><fancy>It’s all a facade.</fancy></center>\n<center><fancy>Room 225.

Your fascination with horror and the macabre earned you the nickname “Spooks” among your friends and classmates. But as you grew, so too did this fascination, until it bordered on obsession. Your appetite for horror evolved from mystery and make-believe to something more. Something <i>real</i>.\nWhen you discovered John Dee’s translation of The Necronomicon, you knew you’d finally found the true horror you had been secretly yearning for. If only you’d known what would be in store for you once you’d read that dreadful tome. You would have locked it back up in Henry Armitage’s restricted collection in the Orne Library and never opened it again.\nOr so you like to think. But even you cannot doubt the allure of the <i>Kitab al-Azif</i>. The Book of the Dead. That is why, when Dr. Armitage summoned you to the Orne Library, the dread in your bones predicted precisely what had occurred.\n“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” Dr. Armitage says as he surveys the destruction. The entire restricted collection is in tattered disarray. The Necronomicon lies open on a nearby table, its metal clasps broken apart. You run your fingers along its leathery, skin-like pages. Your eyes flit along the words in a familiar dance:\n<center><i>“They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness.”</i></center>\nYour throat tightens as you realize what must have occurred. Something has been unleashed, and you are the only one who can figure out how to stop it…"

The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.\nSo far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”\n\n–Minnie Klein"

You ascend the staircase once more and position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun.

If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help...only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up.

You dare not turn and look behind you, for you know that what you see will likely break your heart, or perhaps your mind. Great polypous horrors slide darkly amidst the blackness and loneliness of the cosmos. You had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it not ringing in your head this very moment.\nThere is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where you must go… The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."

      "text": "“Ladies and gentlemen,” Josef Meiger announces, raising a glass of champagne in a toast. A hush descends on the room, until only the crackle of the fireplace and whispers of gossip can be heard. “Allow me to welcome you all into my home for this year’s charity gala. We have some very upstanding citizens here tonight, and I thank all of you for your hard work and generosity.” Cheers and murmurs of agreement fill the room. Many of the guests raise their glasses to Valentino, one of the most esteemed members of the Lodge this year, who sits at the Guest of Honor table, which is nearest to the fireplace.\nJosef ’s assistant, Jerome, blends into the wall behind Josef, discreetly checking his pocket watch. In another corner of the room, the head housekeeper, Penny, walks from table to table, filling empty glasses and collecting dirty salad plates. “Each of you has done great deeds in the name of the Silver Twilight Lodge and our historic city,” Josef continues. “Next year, we will continue to shoulder this burden and do what must be done for the sake of progress.” Jerome steps forward quietly, interrupting Josef ’s speech with the unassuming confidence that comes from years of trusted service. He taps Josef lightly on his shoulder and shows him the time. “I’m afraid I am already out of time. Thank you all very much for attending,” Josef concludes, bowing. Polite applause rises from the audience, and Josef walks briskly toward the parlor, followed closely by his assistant. Two servants collect coats as latecomers trickle into the manor, and Gavriella—Josef ’s head of security—watches over the entrance with hard eyes and a clenched jaw. “Has Mr. Sanford arrived?” Josef asks curtly, tapping his polished leather shoe on the floor.\nI’m afraid not,” Jerome replies, flipping through the last pages of the estate’s guest book. “But he should be here any minute, Mr. Meiger.”\n“Good. I want there to be no problems whatsoever when he arrives; am I understood?” Josef calls out to Gavriella: “Make sure he is well protected.” Gavriella nods, patting the handle of her .45 in her shoulder holster. Josef turns his attention back to his assistant. “And have Penny make sure the main course is kept good and hot while we wait for Mr. Sanford’s arrival. Not a single slice is to be served without his presence.”\n“Not even for Mr. Rivas, sir?” Jerome asks, glancing at Josef over the rim of his thick glasses. Josef pauses for a moment, considering.\n“Pour Mr. Rivas another glass of champagne, and I am sure he will not complain. Also, I’m still waiting on those accounts I asked you about earlier today. Don’t forget,” Josef says, clapping his assistant on the shoulder before walking back into the banquet hall. Jerome nods obediently and heads upstairs.\nSoon after, the dark mist would appear, and nothing would be the same."

By now, the remaining guests have filed into the banquet hall, and you can hear the sounds of merriment and drinking coming from beyond the wooden door behind you. You pay them no mind, remaining vigilant. Years of fighting and discipline have taught you to be ready for anything, even at a harmless banquet like this. Just as you begin to ponder whether your talents are being wasted under Mr. Meiger’s employ, a dark mist invades the parlor through the front door and the window frames, flooding the room. At first, you believe it to be only the evening fog seeping through the manor’s entryway, until you begin to notice that everything the mist touches seems to have decayed as though aged hundreds of years.\nYou step back cautiously, keeping a hand on the grip of your weapon just in case. Never in all your years have you seen something like this. An unnatural chill spreads throughout the room, and shivers run up your spine. As the ashen mist finishes pouring in, it coalesces into a singular form: a humanoid figure wrapped in shadows. It raises its hand and points at you with a charred, blackened finger.\nYou unholster your firearm and point it at the creature, allowing your training to take over. “Don’t come any closer!” you shout. The thing watching you from the entrance is unfazed. Its ethereal form begins to glide toward you, dark mist crawling over the carpet in its wake. “I warned you,” you growl, and a thunderous shot echoes through the parlor as you squeeze the trigger. The bullet rips a hole in the figure’s head like a rush of air billowing through a column of smoke. The mist stitches itself together, and the thing continues to drift your way, reaching out menacingly.\nNothing could have prepared you for combat with such an unnatural enemy. Faced with no other option, you turn and flee up the staircase nearby, pausing to squeeze off several more shots at the top. The bullets that make their target simply pass harmlessly through the ghostly figure, striking the door behind it. A few stray shots shatter a column of the staircase’s wooden balustrade."

You have served Mr. Meiger faithfully for almost a decade, and he trusts you with sensitive information like this—a point of pride for you. While you are often curious about your employer’s business, you have never pried into his personal matters. Not until tonight, anyway.\nYou adjust your glasses and lean forward as you turn to the page regarding Mr. Meiger’s request. Some of the names on the list you recognize: Rivas, Gensler, Fairmont, Rhodes, Wick. But many are names you have never heard of before, let alone seen affiliated with Mr. Meiger’s work: Lindquist, Konstantinov, Magro, Atkinson, Lamar…Just how deep do Mr. Meiger’s connections go?\nStrange as that may seem, it is the list of names on the page afterward that raises your hackles. While it was clear that the names on the previous page are associates of Mr. Meiger’s, or at least prominent members of the Lodge, you can only assume that this next series of names is of people your employer is…targeting. For what, you cannot say.\nYou stand next to Josef ’s desk and record the list in your pocket journal carefully, making sure to keep the names in the exact order they appear in Mr. Meiger’s ledger. You hope that your suspicion is nothing more than the absurd imagination of an overworked secretary. Still, something about all of this has you concerned. That, and the sudden draft of frigid air that has somehow wafted into the room. Your gaze naturally drifts to the window, at which point you scream out in shock and lose your balance, stumbling backward into Mr. Meiger’s desk.\nPressed up against the office window is a host of screaming faces emerging from the mist, or perhaps composed of it. Their ghostly hands press against the glass, their eyes hollow and empty. Your reading glasses clatter to the ground and shatter under your heel as you scramble to the other side of the office. You don’t realize that you dropped your pocket journal in the chaos until it is too late."

The dreary gambrel rooftops and Victorian manors of French Hill span the view below you, the unlit windows hiding countless secrets.\nYou can’t remember a night in which your employer was as concerned with every little detail as he is tonight. He is normally so calm, so collected. There’s something special about tonight that has him on edge. Is it Mr. Sanford? A shudder crawls through you. For some reason, something about that man gives you the creeps. But Josef has interacted with Mr. Sanford many times before, so that cannot be the reason. What could it be that has Mr. Meiger so worried?\nYou are torn from your thoughts by the gathering of grey clouds overhead, swiftly blotting out the night sky. As the clouds grow ever closer, you begin to see shapes emerging from the vapor. You squint and lean over the railing for a better view. That is when you notice the true forms of the shapes in the mist: their screaming faces, their clawing hands, all writhing in torment and coming straight for you. You cry out in terror and back up against the wall as the mist envelops the building. A spectral shape emerges from the haze beyond the railing, dressed in bloodstained rags. It begs for rest in a croaking, gasping voice. Your only hope for escape is to retreat back into the manor and call for help..."

Your opponent sets the ivory ball back on the table with a sigh.\n“I can’t help myself around ivory. You know that, Tino,” Adam replies. You rarely see Adam Gensler except during Lodge functions, but you prefer his company to that of the stuffy business types who make up most of the Lodge these days. He makes his shot, the sudden clattering interrupting the din of conversation. “Your shot, Tino. And do try to avoid hitting the nine ball first. You’re always so overeager.” Adam chuckles as he moves to the other side of the table, making way for you.\n“That was one time, my friend, one time.” You roll your eyes. Truth be told, you’ve enjoyed coming to these events for the opportunity to give back to the community, not to hobnob with Arkham’s gentry. But hobnobbing has had its perks.\nYou lean over the table and clear your mind as you line up your shot. The room falls silent as you block out the clamor and the music, focusing all of your attention on the one ball and the corner pocket. You hold your breath and strike the cue ball. It clacks as it hits its target, and the one ball drops effortlessly into the corner pocket. “There, you see?”\nIt is only then that you realize the silence around you is not just in your mind. All of the light and warmth has been sucked out of the room. Adam is gone, along with everyone else who was present just moments before you took your shot. “Hello?” you call out. A dark mist coils about your ankles as you walk around the billiards table. “If this is a practical joke of some kind, it’s in awfully poor taste,” you remark. The only response is the deep growl that emerges from beneath the table. Morbid curiosity compels you to look underneath it, at which point a dark hound pounces onto your chest, savagely clawing at your torso. You react instinctively, pushing it off of your body as hard as you can. It lands on the billiards table, causing it to collapse under the creature’s weight. You slowly back up as the creature rises to its feet once again and jumps off the broken table, its hollow eyes gazing into your soul."

You quickly shift one of the room’s bookcases aside and hide behind it before they enter the room. “You’re sure you heard something in here? I don’t see anybody,” one of them says.\n“Hm…” the other pauses, presumably inspecting the room for signs of intruders. “Must have been nothing.”\n“It’s all right. We’re all a bit on edge since the trap box went missing. Come, we don’t want to be late for the ceremony. Tonight is an important night.” Their footfalls become softer as they depart. The man’s words linger in your thoughts momentarily. What did he mean by tonight being an important night? This could be just as important as the puzzle box they had been attempting to open. You quietly follow the two men as they head deep into the tunnels beneath the Lodge. You struggle to keep up with them while trying to keep your footsteps silent on the stone floor of the passageway. Finally, they enter a large door with the familiar three arrows of Silver Twilight emblazoned along its surface. Ritualistic chanting fills the hall from the other side. You approach softly, placing your ear against the door to listen in.\n“Brothers and sisters,” an elderly voice announces, “thank you for coming to this hallowed gathering. The time we have long waited for approaches.” You recognize the man’s voice – it is Carl Sanford, president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and once again we must do what has to be done in order to protect it.” The crowd responds with solemn approval. “Tonight, we will complete the ritual we began many nights ago at the center of the Unvisited Isle. Tonight, we will finally bind the revenant and learn what it knows. We must not allow the secrets of AZATHOTH to be lost to those who would do humanity harm.”\nThe cult replies with a monotone hymn, and you take this opportunity to flee the Lodge before you are discovered. The conspiracy you have unveiled leaves you with even more questions. If the revenant Mr. Sanford speaks of is what you think it is, binding it will surely protect Arkham, as he claims. But what knowledge do they seek to learn from it?…and what in the hell is an “AZATHOTH?”",

You’re not sure whether it broke as a result of the beast’s emergence or as a result of its death, but either way, it is a regretful outcome. “This didn’t work as planned,” one of the robed members of the Order states matter-of-factly as you examine the crushed puzzle box.\n“That’s a hell of an understatement,” another adds. She places a hand on your shoulder and gently pulls you away from the remains of the device. “Come on, that’s a lost cause,” she says.\nHer partner ignores your presence and stoically addresses her. “We’ll have to get to the Unvisited Isle and complete the binding rite without the trap.” She nods and takes one last look at you before the remaining Lodge members flee the building.

You wish you could just return home and forget everything that has happened in the last few weeks, but you know that is just a pipe dream. After hours of aimless meandering, you snap back to reality when you realize you have wandered into Independence Square. A soft breeze carries a trail of brittle leaves across the grass of the clearing, drawing your eyes upward. There, sitting amidst a circle of autumn-colored leaves, sits Anna Kaslow. Her eyes are closed in a deep trance, her fingers pressed against the temples of her head. Laid out on the grass in front of her is a wool blanket, and on top of that, a circle of overlapping facedown tarot cards. You approach and take a seat in front of the fortune teller. It’s only now that you realize just how sore and tired you are. Every one of your muscles aches with pain, and it takes a significant amount of effort for you to not immediately pass out."

The battle may be over, but your struggle has not yet ended.” Misery catches in your throat. You want nothing more than for this nightmare to be over, but Anna’s words ring true: you know it will not end unless you put an end to it yourself.\nA flash of light burns across the sky, followed swiftly by a resounding crack of thunder. The clouds above are not natural. Phantasmal shapes shift and churn within the mist above. If you listen closely, you can faintly hear their howls of pain and sadness drifting on the wind. “It has begun,” Anna utters quietly. You rise to your feet, ignoring your exhaustion, your pain, and your fear."

Understanding why they have come, you step aside and allow them to do their work.\nOne of the witches draws a circle in the dirt around Anette, while the rest bind her with tendrils of searing energy. The revenant shrieks and wails in agony, but the witches dare not cease. Finally, as their chants rise to a crescendo, Erynn pierces the sanctity of the circle with her knife, pressing firmly against the air and straining as though she were attempting to pierce solid stone. Keziah’s ghost departs in a whirl of spectral mist, dissipating into thin air with a final cry. Anette’s body, unsupported, collapses to the ground. “It’s over,” you say, placing a hand on Erynn’s shoulder.\n“No,” she replies harshly, gesturing to the sky above. The storm clouds have all disappeared, yet you count not a single star in the night sky. The borders of the horizon frame the empty void above you, a breach so enormous you had not even realized it was there. How long had it loomed over the city while you spent your time warding against lesser incursions?\nYou ask what can be done to close a breach of such size. She clenches her jaw. “I don’t know. But I know who does.” She kneels over Anette, raises her hand, and slaps her hard across the face. Anette jerks awake, startled out of her catatonic state.\n“Is this what you wanted, sister?” Erynn drags her to her feet, forcing her to look up at the catastrophe she has wrought.\n“You know it isn’t,” Anette replies, her voice ragged. “I only wanted us all to have some semblance of the strength she possessed. I had no desire to use it in the same way she did. But the spirit took control, and I could not resist.” She lowers her head in resignation. “I’m sorry, sisters. I failed us all. I was not strong enough.”",

You ask what can be done to close a breach of such size, but before he can respond, coils of darkness emerge from the shadows, twisting into dark cloaks. In seconds you are surrounded by the witches of Anette’s coven. The high priestess steps forward, glaring at Carl Sanford with all of the intensity of hell itself.\n“Do not trust the word of this sinister worm,” she warns you. “Everything he has done, he has done to further his own agenda. He would gladly hold the world hostage if it meant one last chance at power.”\nDespite his wounds, Sanford rises to his feet and bellows back at her: “What hypocrisy! Do you forget that it was you and your misguided sect who started all of this? Summoning the dead, asking them for power?” He scoffs. “We would have elevated all of humanity. You sought only to elevate yourselves.” Sanford turns to appeal to your judgment one last time. “Do not be a fool,” he says quietly. “This outcome is not what the Lodge desires.

The witches’ only show of resistance is the blood that drips from their eyes as their unwilling spell reaches its culmination.\n“It is time!” The disembodied voice of Keziah declares through Anette’s lips. “The Primal Chaos awaits!

But perhaps it is my fault; I should not have imposed such a heavy burden on a neophyte to the Order.”\nMr. Sanford rises to his feet, and the other members of the Order follow suit. He addresses the other members of the Inner Circle: “All right. We have no more time to spare. The ritual must be completed at once. We shall use the same site as before—the central pillar of the Unvisited Isle, where the barrier between this world and the next is thinnest. It is likely that the anomaly will pursue us there, so act with caution.” Then he turns back to you. “We will require your assistance as well, of course. The device you hold is the key to binding the revenant. You must use it properly when the time comes. Do you understand?” You nod in affirmation. Taking a deep breath to steel your nerves, you prepare for the journey to the Unvisited Isle—a journey toward death itself."

You demand an explanation, but the elderly man cuts you off with a scowl. “Yes, yes. You speak of the incident last week. That was the creature’s first manifestation, and the arrival of the dark mist, which you encountered inside.” He glances at the front door to the manor and clears his throat. “The Lodge was not involved in the disappearances that occurred that night,” he explains after a short pause. “But we couldn’t exactly go to the police and tell them a creature made of mist kidnapped four people in Mr. Meiger’s household, could we? So, we had to take matters into our own hands. We suspected that creature was drawn to the crowd, so we recreated the incident in order to understand what happened—to discern its motives.” The decision to host another event at Mr. Meiger’s estate so soon after the disappearances makes sense to you now. As much as you hate to admit it, there is some logic to the plan the Lodge put into action, although you don’t particularly like being used as bait. Who knows how many innocent bystanders were put in mortal danger? Even if the goal was noble, was it worth the sacrifice?\n“I hope you understand that our organization only seeks the betterment of humankind. There are harsh truths that lie beyond our five senses,” Mr. Sanford says, his expression grim. “If we are to survive and prosper, we must adapt. We must learn. We must understand. That is what our order seeks to achieve—a greater understanding of the world around us. A worthy pursuit, don’t you agree?”"

You conclude your story, and the elderly man considers your words. “Interesting,” he says at last. “I know of this coven. They are led by a witch named Anette Mason. Their magic is no trivial thing. They have passed down arcane secrets that can manipulate the energies of the universe. It is dangerous knowledge they possess—knowledge I believe they derived from a powerful witch who fled from Salem over two hundred years ago. Does the name ‘Keziah’ mean anything to you?”\nYou nod. Everyone in Arkham has at least some passing knowledge of the witch whose ghost supposedly haunts the old condemned “Witch House” in French Hill. Most believe her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the decrepit house. Mr. Sanford’s steely gaze and humorless tone makes it clear to you that this is not the case. “Perhaps this Anette is a true descendant of Keziah, or perhaps she is simply using her name. In any event, I believe these events are connected. To that end, I have a task for you, on behalf of the Silver Twilight Lodge.” Carl Sanford rises to his feet, using his cane more for show than for balance. You rise as well, ready to perform whatever duties are necessary to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n“We need as much information about this coven as we can obtain.

You are positive that the events you experienced in the woods last week have something to do with the creature that kidnapped those four unfortunate souls. It’s just a hunch—a feeling that crawls along the back of your neck, imploring you to look away—but you’re sure that everything is connected. You’re just not sure how.\nAs you enter, one of the Historical Society’s many researchers greets you and asks if she can help in any way. You give a cursory description of the information you’re looking for; just enough that she can direct you where to look, but vague enough to leave your motives at the door. “I don’t know why you are researching such morbid affairs, but the records you are looking for should be in the library on the third floor,” the researcher says.\nYou thank her and head to the third floor, where you begin to study the history of witchcraft in Arkham. In the late 17th century, Arkham was one of the New England towns caught up in the hysteria of witch trials. Accusations of witchcraft spread like wildfire, and many of the accused were executed by hanging or burning, guilty and innocent alike. But there was one witch whose infamy rose above the rest, and whose mystical power was never in question: Keziah Mason.\nYou recognize the name as the ghost who supposedly haunts the old Witch House in French Hill. You had always thought her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the condemned house. But the Historical Society’s records indicate that Keziah was a real person: a powerful witch who had fled from Salem over two hundred years ago.\nYou are no stranger to real witchcraft. If Keziah Mason has anything to do with the coven you encountered in the woods, you must discover that connection. You leave the manor and head toward French Hill, where the Witch House awaits…"

One question lingers in your mind as you consider the events that have transpired: Does Keziah’s spirit linger because of the mist, or is the mist caused by her presence? Which is the disease, and which the symptom?\nThe more you delve into Arkham’s history of witchcraft and persecution, the more restless you become. Night after night, you are assaulted by terrible dreams—dreams of death and decay, of guilt and sin. There is an evil that dwells in this city, an evil that has long remained hidden in the darkness of Arkham’s past. What’s worse, your inquiry has reached an impasse. You believe that if you can find the coven of witches you saw in the woods that fateful night, you might be able to learn more about Keziah Mason or of this unspoken evil.\nAs you go through your morning routine, your eyes drift across one of the smaller headlines of today’s newspaper: “Ghost Sightings on Hangman’s Hill? Residents of Uptown claim to have seen human shapes in the thick fog emanating from Hangman’s Brook…” It couldn’t be a coincidence, could it?\nThen the realization dawns on you—if it is witches you seek, the only place you can be certain to find them is six feet underground, in the place where professed witches were executed all those years ago. Searching for specters in a graveyard may not be your safest bet, but you’re not sure one can stay safe in this city anymore."

Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."

But I do not believe these are the ones you speak of,” she replies to the red-haired accuser. You lower your weapons as several of the hooded figures approach and surround their leader.

Shadows from beyond the tree line suddenly twist and coil into the clearing, tugging at the edges of the witches’ cloaks.

One lowers itself until it reaches the height of your shoulders, offering its back to you. Swallowing the very last of your doubts and your fear, you climb aboard the creature.

      "text": "The Unvisited Isle lies in the midst of the Miskatonic River, in between two of the bridges that span the river and connect the Downtown and Rivertown neighborhoods of Arkham. Overgrown with vines, thorns, and unnatural underbrush, the island is home to no residents and very few fauna. Rows of mysterious stone pillars stand sentry throughout the island, rising high above the treetops. Though many theories abound, none know for sure what purpose these stone pillars serve, or who built them. Very few dare to venture onto the shores of the enigmatic island, and those who do return with strange tales: bonfires in the woods at the darkest hours of night—stone altars with deep carvings impossible to translate—empty woods devoid of life, save for the stark-black ravens and whippoorwills who perch on the tree branches and watch trespassers with eager eyes. Unfortunately for you, the stakes are too high for you to heed these many warnings.\nThe streets of Arkham are emptier and quieter than you have ever seen them before. A familiar grey mist has enveloped the town. The haze grows denser and thicker the closer you get to the river. You move with haste, not wanting to encounter any others on your way to the site of the ritual, whether they be living or dead. You find several rowboats moored by the docks and climb aboard one of them. With the waters unnaturally still and barely any current carrying the boat, rowing toward the island should be a simple endeavor. Even so, the dense fog makes it difficult for you to get your bearings. Soon, you are completely enclosed by the grey mist, unable to see the banks of the river or the coast of the island. Shapes emerge from the fog. Ripples appear on the surface of the water. The gaze of the watcher is upon you.\nJust then, a pillar of spectral energy ascends into the sky, clear as day even through the haze. The shapes all turn their attention to this beacon, and you sense the watcher’s gaze slipping from your soul. The rite has begun. You row faster, using the light to guide you. It is time to decide once and for all why you have come—are you here to aid the Silver Twilight Lodge? Or to disrupt them?"

      "text": "<i>Following scenario 1–A, the dreamers travel beyond the Enchanted Woods…</i>\nAs you travel out of the Enchanted Woods, you pass through rolling green meadows under a bright-blue, cloudless sky. You speak with the blond-haired man—who introduces himself as Randolph Carter— for several hours along your journey south. You pass through a town Randolph calls Nir and over a stone bridge spanning a wide river. Since the man seems friendly and knowledgeable about both your world and this one, you explain to him your situation: that you had followed the writings of a man named Virgil Gray to reach this strange land, in order to see for yourself the truth of his story. “There is a place in Ulthar where you may yet meet this man for yourself,” Randolph responds. “When we reach Ulthar, I will show you.”\nThe town of Ulthar is not quite what you had imagined. The border of the town is marked by a cobblestone road separating its quaint cottages from the rolling green meadows beyond. Inside the town, narrow cobbled streets are filled almost to capacity with cats of all kinds and colors, which part as you approach. Old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories arch over the hilly streets; the entire village seems a haphazard cluster of homes and old-fashioned businesses. As you reach the town square near the center of the village, Randolph stops and addresses you with a youthful smile. “Welcome to Ulthar,” he proclaims. “As I mentioned before, you are quite safe here. There is but one paramount law to keep in mind as you traverse this place: in the town of Ulthar, no one may kill a cat.” Given how utterly packed the streets are with cats, you wonder aloud if this is indeed a town run by cats. “Not quite,” Randolph replies, pondering your words, “though I suppose one might call it the center of cat society here in the Dreamlands. The reason for that law’s existence is a story for another time. First, come—I have a feeling we’ll find this ‘Virgil’ fellow you speak of at Einar’s.”\nRandolph leads you through the town square, which is surrounded by buildings adorned with cat motifs in the form of statues, signs, and even stained-glass windows. You eventually arrive at one such building bearing a sign that reads “Einar’s Place.” Inside is a medieval-style tavern filled with long wooden tables. You spot several patrons and three times as many cats. One such patron at the wooden counter feeds one of the cats small strips of dried meat. He is a handsome man in his early thirties, with short dark hair, a strong jaw, and sharp cheekbones. You recognize him instantly as the writer Virgil Gray. In the back of your mind, you wonder if this chance meeting is merely an act of fortune or something preordained, for good or for ill.\nRegardless, you approach the man and introduce yourself, along with Randolph. Virgil shakes your hand and Randolph’s with a joyful smile. “Well met, fellow dreamers!” the writer says, a hint of boyish excitement in his voice. “It is wonderful to meet more fellow believers. I had become so sick and tired of reading about my supposed ‘illness’ in the papers.”\nYou nod your head in agreement and inform Virgil that you intend to find some proof of this discovery to bring back to the waking world. “Don’t you think I tried that?” he replies, stymied. “Sadly, it is impossible for one who is asleep to bring anything from this realm into the real world. This is all imagination, you see. Ideas, concepts, fantasies. You cannot hold a thought in your hands, can you?”\nRandolph interjects. “There is a place within the Dreamlands that may hold the proof you seek. I have seen it in my dreams. I visited there three times, each time just a fleeting moment before I was snatched away by the rising sun…but try as I might, I cannot find the way again. I have spent many nights searching.”\n“Oh?” Virgil asks, intrigued. “And what is this place?”\n“It is a marvelous city,” he describes, his eyes aglow with wonder, “golden and lovely like nothing I have seen before or since. A city beyond the peaks of the unknown mountain Kadath, where no one has ever set foot before. There, veiled within the clouds and crowned by stars, lies the onyx castle of the Great Ones.”\nVirgil idly pets the cat on the countertop next to him as he is absorbed by Randolph’s tale. It is a slender creature with lustrous black fur, dark as the void of space itself. “Then we must find this place! Even if it does not have the proof we seek, it sounds like the adventure of a lifetime. Enough to fill a hundred pages, or more!”\nYou tell Virgil and Randolph that before you commit to such an adventure, you must return to the waking world and tell your companions about your experiences. Just then, another voice, cryptic and quiet, chimes: “Oh, you can’t wake up. The eye is upon you now.”\nYou and the others spin your heads around, searching for the source of the voice. The barkeeper? Another patron? Then Virgil’s black cat stretches and sits up, its piercing yellow eyes reflecting the light of the sun through the window outside. “I have waited a long time for you to seek Kadath,” it says.\n“You can talk?” Virgil says, nearly toppling over his stool as he jumps in surprise.\n“I’m a cat, you dolt. Of course I can talk,” the black cat replies, licking its paw out of boredom. “You have met a thousand cats from Ulthar, and now you are surprised?”\n“But…I thought…” Virgil wipes his brow with his palm.\n“Never mind him,” the black cat says, addressing you directly. “I assure you, you cannot cross back into the waking world until you find Kadath. It is your only way out. In the meantime, I will return and tell your companions about the quest ahead of you.” It hops off of the countertop and walks confidently toward the exit. “Though I imagine their task will be even more arduous…”"

It belongs to a blond-haired man in a brown traveling coat, who leans against a nearby tree. “These woods are not forgiving to the faint of heart.” The scarred cat walks to the man’s side, and the man leans over to pet its back.\nYou ask the man where you are and how he came to this place, but he cuts you off. “I will explain in due time. For now, we must follow the path to the town of Ulthar. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your ordeals.” He turns to the cat and utters a word in an odd language—a password of sorts, you suspect—but the cat simply wanders off toward a hedge, where you see several other cats banded together. “Do it yerself,” it replies.\n“Don’t mind the cats,” the man says to you quietly as the cats depart. “They are useful allies, but also independent creatures with no need for you or me. When we reach Ulthar, you may get the chance to meet others of their kind. But first things first.” Together, you leave the eaves of the enchanted forest behind.",

The creatures timidly drop their “tribute” of birds in front of the cats and quietly depart. “My apologies on behalf of the Zoogs,” the man says as he approaches. “They are curious creatures, and not usually so…agitated. It is good that we showed up when we did.” The leader of the cats jumps on a tree stump and adds, “Yes, yes. Them vile Zoogs have done their part, now let’s do ours and leave this forsaken place. What say yeh?”\nYou cannot contain your excitement. Zoogs, talking cats—everything you have read about is real. You begin to ask the man more about this world, but he cuts you off. “I will explain in due time. For now, we must follow the path to the town of Ulthar. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your travels.” He turns to the old, scarred cat and utters a word in an odd language—a password of sorts, you suspect—and the cat replies with a quick nod.

Had you known these rodent-like creatures were intelligent all along, you might have tried to communicate with them much earlier. You inform them that you are just travelers in this faraway land and that you simply wish to pass through peacefully. The creatures chitter among themselves for a moment: “They are kind!” “They are not with the black cat after all!” “Summon the Council of Sages!” After a short while, several more of them appear, each with withering grey fur and a frail, thin body. The eldest one peeks behind you and states that they will aid you if you get the cats to leave.\nSomehow, you contain your disbelief and politely ask the cats to come back another time. “All right,” the scarred cat replies, “but you ain’t seen the last of us.” The cats retreat to the edge of the woods, though their human companion stays behind with you. Once the cats are out of earshot, one of the elders offers you a gourd of what appears to be fermented tree sap, which you accept graciously.\n“It is the wine of the moon-tree,” the man behind you explains quietly, stepping forward. “The Zoogs do not give such gifts lightly. They are curious creatures, but not without wisdom. Now that you may speak freely with their elders, try asking them a question. They know more of the dealings of this land than you might think.”\nYou describe the author Virgil Gray and ask the Zoogs if they have seen a man fitting that description pass through these woods. You add that he would have walked this path many times. A hush falls over the Zoogs, and some of them immediately depart into the deep foliage. “We have met this human,” one of the elders replies with a flutter just louder than a whisper. “He often comes this way. He is kind but foolish. Take the road to Ulthar. You may meet him.” Then it adds with a low growl: “…but beware the cat that follows him. All cats are liars, but the black cat especially.” You thank the ancient Zoog for its wisdom and depart, led by the blond man and his feline escort. The cats eye you suspiciously after your discussion with the Zoogs. The man breaks the tension. “If you are heading to Ulthar to find this friend of yours, allow me to guide you there. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your travels.”\nZoogs. Talking cats. This can’t all be a figment of your imagination. Somehow, you can see a layer of truth beneath all of this absurdity. For better or for worse, the Zoog council has confirmed the reality of your situation: the Dreamlands are real, and Virgil Gray is here.",

      "text": "Over the next few days, you learn more about your captors, but nothing about the black galley’s destination. It seems the Corsairs who hunted you down and captured you were only agents—or perhaps slaves—of a much greater evil: a race of greyish-white toad-like creatures with no eyes and slippery skin concealed beneath a loose disguise of silken clothing. You notice the creatures tend to stay below deck, and none of them deign to interact with you at all. Despite their disguises, the mere sight of one makes you retch. If they are indeed the masters of the Corsairs, this cannot bode well for you. You are kept apart from Virgil, and suspect he is on a different ship entirely.\nMore days pass. You have no way of telling how long it’s been since your capture. You have been kept well fed—that is, if being forced to eat bitter porridge from a dirty clay bowl counts as “well fed.” What concerns you most is the ship itself. Though you are sure it’s still moving, you no longer feel it rock back and forth as the waves push it from side to side, nor do you hear the sounds of the ocean or of gulls cawing over the coast. In fact, you hear very little at all now: only the occasional commands of one of the beasts from below deck, and the shouting of Corsairs in reply. No churning sea. No wind in the sails. Nothing at all.\nPanic seizes your mind. What if you are destined for some strange port from which there can be no return? Could they have have sailed off the face of the planet itself? You have to do something. Escape, somehow. You try desperately to come up with a plan of action, but in vain. Corsairs relentlessly patrol the brig, and even if you managed to slip your bonds and sneak past them, where would you go?\nJust as you begin to lose hope, a familiar face descends from the top deck. It is the ship captain you hired in Dylath-Leen: a chubby, middleaged fellow with a bushy beard and long hair pulled into a bun atop his head. He peeks around, realizes he is alone with you, and runs to your side. “I am so sorry, my friends,” he stammers quietly. “I had no idea who I was dealing with. I was tricked, I swear. I did not know that they were…I did not know…” he trails off, red-faced with guilt. You aren’t entirely sure what he means, but obviously he had something to do with your capture. Regardless, he is your only chance at escape. You tell him all will be forgiven if he helps you. He ponders for a moment, looks around, then finally nods and slices through your bonds with a curved knife.\nFreedom has never tasted so sweet. You stretch your aching muscles and search nearby for your belongings, but there is little time to waste. Keeping a lookout, your rescuer whispers, “There may be a rowboat you can use on the top deck, but we’ll have to be quiet as mice. If they spot—” his voice suddenly catches in his throat, along with a sharp, jagged blade. He makes a dreadful gurgle as blood wells in his mouth, and he collapses. Behind him, a Corsair flashes a sadistic grin at his next victims: you."

Or perhaps not. For the sake of your own sanity, it may be better not to dwell on suspicions of betrayal.\n“How does one even sail to the Moon?” you ask, befuddled. By now, you are no stranger to the oddities of the Dreamlands, having spent weeks exploring its cities, wilds, and places stranger still. Even knowing the laws of physics and astronomy should not apply here, you struggle to imagine how one might sail a ship into space.\n“It will be a long journey,” Randolph answers. “Far across the sea lie the Basalt Pillars of the West. Between these pillars, the ocean plunges off the edge of the world. If we sail off of the precipice between them, we can cross the void of space itself.”\nYou shouldn’t be surprised that the world of Earth’s Dreamlands is flat; after all, everything else here is a fiction, too. Still, you are incredulous. “I have sailed this route before,” Randolph says, sensing your skepticism. “But I fear this time it might be a one-way trip, especially without a crew. We may need to find an altogether different way to unknown Kadath. Are you prepared?”\nYou look to the horizon, where the cerulean sea meets the sky. Somewhere out there, your aid is needed. What’s more, the proof you seek may lie across the sea—over the edge of the very world itself. You prepare to embark."

It is dressed in grey robes and heavy wrappings, but you see its true visage beneath: its slippery, clammy flesh and its drooling, bulbous lips. “Wonderful,” it praises its henchmen. “Our master will be pleased.” Behind you, Corsairs prevent your escape, while a row of winged things on either side of you squawk rhythmically and flap their wings. A preparation, you suspect, for an unpleasant journey.\nThe moon-beast orders its slaves to haul you onto the winged creatures. “Bring these wretches to the sacrificial pits,” it decrees. “They must be judged for their heresy. The moon lizard shall feed well tonight.”\n“What? No, this isn’t right.” Randolph grits his teeth.\nThere is a bright flash of light, and you <i>awaken</i>. You are sitting atop a comfortless and unfamiliar bed. A wave of relief washes over you at first. Have you finally awoken from this endless dream? Then the still, cold void embraces you, and you realize where you truly are. Instead of four walls and a ceiling, you are surrounded by a bright, starry cosmos. Galaxies and nebulae in the distance seem to stare back at you with unfeeling cruelty. Your bed floats along the thinnest of silver threads.

The Cold Wastes is the region wherein unknown Kadath lies. With any luck, they will bring us right to our destination—” Randolph is cut off as the moon-beast grabs him and pulls him to his feet.\n“No, not you. I know of you. You will be a gift. Fodder for the moon lizard. Come.” It drags Randolph away before your very eyes. His screams echo off the walls of the temple and fade as he is hauled underground.

You plead with him to aid you in your search for unknown Kadath, believing it to be of the utmost importance. “You should not seek to disturb the gods,” the man warns, his song interrupted. “They are far greater than you or I. Do you not see the folly in your ambition?” You beseech him once more, telling him you must bring back proof of the Dreamlands, and cannot return home without the aid of the gods. “Would that be so dire a fate? Look around you.”\nYou do as the captain requests, and are met with a scene of such serene beauty that it leaves you breathless. The seas below glitter in the moonlight like an ocean of diamonds. Along the horizon, you see crystalline coastlines, blissful countrysides, lush mountain vistas, and emerald-green gardens. The air is crisp and cool as you descend below the clouds. Your heart swells with the sweet fragrance of flowers from the nearby coast. Never in all your years in “reality” have you experienced a beauty so <i>real</i>.\nMaybe staying wouldn’t be so bad.

Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance, however, was anything but typical.\nIt all began in the latest issue of <i>Tales from Nevermore</i>. A writer by the name of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the moon, and a curious talking cat…among other things equally difficult to believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention. Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, <i>Tales from Nevermore</i> began to receive and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the ears of experts.\nVirgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently, experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?\nYou and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong…"

As your vision adjusts, you are transfixed by its piercing yellow eyes, bright as the dawn light. You recognize the shape as Virgil’s talking cat. You ask the black cat how long it has been sitting there.\n“Long enough to know you are neither waking nor asleep,” it replies paradoxically.\nThe nature of this world still confounds you. Can one even sleep in the Dreamlands? If so, where would their minds go? Curious, you pose this question to the cat.\n“Those here in their physical bodies can, but you are something else entirely. Now, never mind all that. On to business.” The black cat leaps onto your bed. “I gave your friends the warning you wanted me to pass along. They are preparing to enter the Dreamlands as well, it seems. In the meantime, I will stay with you. Somebody has to watch over you and my pet human, anyway.”"

You still aren’t quite sure what to think of either of them, but you have a good sense of where you should go next. After all, this is not your first excursion into the fabled land of dreams. Addressing Randolph, you suggest talking to the high priest Atal in the nearby Temple of the Elder Ones. It is a name you heard the last time you visited the city of Ulthar in your sleep, though until now you had no reason to seek the priest’s advice. Randolph gives you a startled glance that transforms quickly into a smirk.\n“How curious,” he says, “I was about to suggest the same. Atal is wise beyond all our measure. He may know where to find the place we seek.”\nVirgil, eager to embark on this adventure, claps his hands. “Well, what are we waiting for? This way, my friends!”\nYou nod and head for the temple, a circular tower of ivoried stone crowning the highest hill in town. A small army of cats patrols its walls. The cat at the head of the formation is none other than the old cat with the scar you encountered in the woods earlier. He steps forward to bar your entry and regards your party with great acrimony.\n“Hello again,” the old cat says with a sharp tone. “I suppose yeh want me to step aside.”"

Even I know not its true location. And that is all well and good, for the fruits of attempting to ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard from again. The gods of Kadath may seem powerless, but they are protected by the Other Gods from the Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. It would be wiser to let all the gods alone and leave this folly behind.”\nAtal’s use of the word “gods” has you curious. You wonder aloud what kind of god might exist in a place like this.\nThe priest shakes his head. “They are not our gods, but the gods of Earth, for this land is but a reflection of yours.”\nYou attempt to pry deeper into Atal’s wisdom with your questioning, but his advice does not budge. “I have already said more than I should,” he insists. “Please, for your sake, pursue this madness no further.”"

In the meantime, your quest grows deadlier with each passing day. No matter where you go, foul, nightmarish creatures pursue you across land and sea. Winged beasts with no faces, horned Corsairs wielding razor-sharp cutlasses and commanding great black galleys—the agents of your demise bear many shapes. You decide to return to your ship, safe from the many dangers of the Dreamlands…or so you thought. Unfortunately, your ship is no safe haven. When you return, the crew and captain are nowhere to be found. There are no signs of struggle, but Virgil, who returned to the ship earlier to prepare for your next departure, is also missing.\n“I fear the worst,” Randolph mourns. “If those fiendish Corsairs captured them, they are in dire trouble. They are agents of the Other Gods from the Outside, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos <smallcaps>Nyarlathotep</smallcaps>.” The mere utterance of the name causes you to shudder, though you do not know why. You ask where they might have been taken. As if discussing any other port of call, he replies: “The beasts who command their black galleys sail from the Moon. If we are to rescue Virgil and our other companions, that is where we must go.”",

Colossal creatures dwell in the deep, dark ocean—a terrible danger to any ship that dares the dreadful seas.\nYour steeds fly over a desolate landscape of ice and snow before landing. In the distance, through a haze of snow, you barely make out the shape of a domed building. One of the winged creatures points in the direction of the foreboding ruin, silently commanding you to proceed.

Along the way, it passes under archways of woven shadow, over cerulean seas that glimmer in the moonlight, and through vast swaths of dense mist. Eventually, you reach a continent far to the north, where even your intrepid captain never ventured. Colossal creatures dwell in the deep, dark ocean—a terrible danger to any ship that dares the dreadful seas. The captain moors the flying ship over a desolate landscape of ice and snow. Several moonbeams emerge from the ship’s white hull, forming a gangway to the tundra below. In the distance, through a haze of snowflakes, you can barely make out the shape of a domed building. “Welcome to the accursed Plateau of Leng,” the elderly captain says with a hint of regret in his voice. “You will find no joy or peace here. Only death. Please, I must implore you once more to forsake this quest and return to fairer lands. Are you sure this is where you would like to disembark?”\nYou nod. The captain sighs in reply. “I see. The White Ship shall sail no more to this forsaken place, for it shakes me to my core. You are on your own from here. I bid you farewell and good luck, fellow traveler.” You cross over bright, vivid moonbeams down onto the bleak expanse below. You will find and scale the peaks of unknown Kadath, or you will die trying."

Pale light shines from atop a great black peak piercing the vibrant firmament, and you know that you approach the end of your quest. You spend untold hours ascending the snow-covered slopes until finally you reach the forbidden steps leading to the castle’s great hall. The castle stands astride a precipice that overlooks the entire continent and the ocean beyond. It is a majestic sight. Above, countless tenebrous towers loom, swathed in a vortex of snow and hail. You break a trail through the crusted snow before the castle, and it soon gives way to smooth, polished onyx. The biting wind quiets to a whistle. You are bathed in a prodigious darkness that fills the vast space. Soon there is nothing but the echoing of your footsteps on the onyx floor and the quiet, lonely stillness of the great hall. Though you have crossed no doorway, you realize now where you stand: inside the halls of the Great Ones. You expected to be met by guards, servants of the gods, or perhaps even those powerful beings themselves, but you are met only by loneliness and foreboding as chilling as the piercing winds outside. You continue forward until at last you reach the end of the hall. Here, flanked by smooth onyx pillars, you find…nothing.\nThere are no gods here. This place is long abandoned.\nVirgil is agape. “I…I don’t understand.”"

You are the one who led us on this quest to begin with.”\nRandolph smiles and places a hand on Virgil’s shoulder. “Yes, I am.

Will you help me right this wrong?” the figure asks. Before Virgil can reply, it pulls its arm back and drives a razorsharp blade of onyx through Virgil’s chest.

Even in places where the Dreamlands borders the waking world, one cannot simply walk between them. I once possessed a key to the Gate of Dreams, but I lost it years ago and have been unable to find it since,” he laments."

The ‘key’ was the sense of wonder, fantasy, and creativity that sparked my imagination when I was young. These are things we do not value in maturity. It is only natural the key to these kinds of dreams should be lost with age.”\n“What foolishness!” the black cat scolds. “It is not ‘maturity’ to leave one’s imagination behind. You have abandoned the best part of you. You are more a mewling kitten now than any child I have ever met.”\n“Perhaps you are right,” Randolph agrees, downcast. “I forced myself to believe that earthly concerns were more important than juvenile fantasies of gilded spires, perfumed jungles, and twilight realms…and now I fear I shall never see such wonders again.” He turns back toward you, his eyes full of regret. “And worse, I will be unable to guide you."

The one they call the <i>Unnamable</i>. I didn’t want to believe that it was truly haunted, as the stories told, but in merely repeating the legend, I drew the creature’s ire.”\nYou ask of the creature, and Randolph closes his eyes as a violent shudder courses up his spine. “It cannot be described. All I know is that we barely survived. It was my fault Joel was hurt. From that day forth, I have had no desire to delve into the supernatural or the superstitious. Not because I did not believe, but because I was frightened. Is that why the key eludes me? Is that why I can no longer dream?” The realization hits him, clear as day. “I know where we have to go. That is where I lost the key. That must be where it can be regained!” he exclaims, wide-eyed.\nAs Randolph frantically tries to hail a taxicab, you realize where he means to go: to the house without a name, where the indescribable creature that still haunts his memory resides…"

Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he wouldn’t have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark and barren realm, you are filled with hollow despair—an emptiness that gnaws at your heart and mirrors the bleak landscape all around you. You came here to help your friends, and now your only guide through this realm is gone. What if this was all a horrible mistake?\nYou shake these dark thoughts from your mind and focus on the path that lies ahead of you. It’s too late to dwell on what you could have done differently. This is your way forward now. Even if you cannot help your friends, even if you are too late to help Randolph, you have another mission now. Clearly this region of the Dreamlands has something to do with the creatures invading your reality. The answers must lie here. Besides, it’s not like you have much choice anymore.\nYou walk to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. This realm is staggeringly vast. In the distance, along the cliffs, you see a walled city, of all things. Among its many towers, a black spire rises so high it must pierce the surface of the Dreamlands. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below, and you can see shapes moving throughout the grey, phosphorescent light. You hope the beings who inhabit this realm are ones you might be able to reason with. You have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he would not have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark, barren realm, you raise your concerns with Randolph. “It is true that we are farther from your companions than we intended, he affirms. “However, if I may offer another sentiment—perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Clearly the Underworld has something to do with the creatures invading our reality. I suggest we investigate further while we have the chance. We can return to the surface of the Dreamlands once we have discovered the truth.”\nYou ask Randolph if he has any leads, and he steps to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. “I have been here before,” he says quietly, getting his bearings. “Those walls in the distance belong to the City of Gugs. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below. That plain is where the ghouls live. Perhaps there we can learn more.” You raise your doubts aloud, wondering if such creatures are even capable of peaceful conversation. “They are more intelligent than you think, and could be quite helpful if we convince them to aid us. In fact, there is one I count among my friends, an artist by the name of Richard Pickman. If we are fortunate enough to find him, that might be our best chance.” You still have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

Far from it, in fact; the entirety of the Underworld seems to be changing with each wave of warped energy that flows through the realm. Walls shift, the floor skews, and the dim, phosphorescent light scintillates with a cosmic, otherworldly glow.

You have no time to question its appearance—survival comes first.\nWhen you pull yourself up, you realize you are curled up on a park bench, surrounded by a thick fog and the grim, gambrel rooftops of Arkham. There is no ground in front of you. Just an open, endless pit into fathomless depths. The Underworld, perhaps? But how is that possible? Virgil’s cat watches you casually from a tree branch that hangs over the park bench. “It won’t stop,” the black cat tells you. “Not until there is nothing left of your world.” You wonder what you could possibly do in the face of such horror. The cat gazes down into the pit below. “It’s waiting for you.”\nAnother rumble. In the distance, you watch with horror as an entire building is sucked into the ground. You think you spot a pedestrian in the distance, but it is no human. If this goes on any longer, your companions won’t have a world to awaken to. You steel yourself, look down into the empty pit, and gulp. “Down you go,” the cat says.\nYou fall. The roar of the wind is deafening as it whips by your head. You can’t possibly survive a fall like this, you think. But instead of splattering against a hard, rocky ground, you are caught by a glowing, sinewy web.

Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance, however, was anything but typical.\nIt all began in the latest issue of <i>Tales from Nevermore</i>. A writer by the name of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the moon, and a curious talking cat…among other things equally difficult to believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention. Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, <i>Tales from Nevermore</i> began to receive and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the ears of experts.\nVirgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently, experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?\nYou and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong…"

      "text": "It has been more than twenty-four hours since your companions fell asleep. Over the course of the past day, your curiosity has slowly turned to concern and then dread. The problems began when one of your friends started to toss and turn violently in their sleep. You snapped to attention and tried to shake them awake, but it was to no avail. You tried everything. Physical contact was no use, and water did nothing but soak their clothes and bed fruitlessly. Even opening their eyelids did not wake them, and in the process, you noticed that their pupils had fully dilated and their eyes were glazed over with a milky-white fog.\nYou have no idea what this could mean for your friends. Have they managed to find their way to the land Virgil Gray described in his writings? Or has something more sinister taken root within their minds and bodies? Just to be safe, you decide to take your companions to St. Mary’s Hospital. If something ails them physically, perhaps the doctors there can discern what is wrong. Otherwise, you will simply have to watch over them and hope that they return safely to the waking world.\nSt. Mary’s is the only hospital in the town of Arkham, and it is a fixture of its Uptown neighborhood. You explain the situation to Nurse Greenberg, the head nurse at the hospital, who instructs several other nurses to carry your companions into the emergency ward on stretchers. She tells you with a warm, friendly smile that your friends will be examined by Doctor Maheswaran, but other than that, you are left entirely in the dark.\nHours pass. You hear nothing about the status of your companions. You still have not met with Doctor Maheswaran, and you’re starting to grow impatient. You feel something crawling along your arm, and you instinctively brush it away, then wonder if it was an insect or a figment of your imagination. You begin to question whether bringing your friends here was the right choice after all. Eventually, you decide to take matters into your own hands.\nIt is late at night, and the receptionist who instructed you to stay in the waiting room is nowhere to be seen. In fact, there are eerily few people roaming the halls of the hospital. With nobody to stop you, you sneak off into the emergency ward to find your friends. It does not take long for you to find their room. Your companions lie asleep on clean, white cots, their sleep anything but peaceful. They are pale faced and sweaty. One of them tosses and turns in their sleep, their brow furrowed with pain or worry.\nDoctor Maheswaran does not seem surprised by your intrusion. “Shivani Maheswaran,” she introduces herself coldly, without looking up from her clipboard. “You’re the ones who brought them in, right? Before you ask: no, I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life,” she says with a hint of dry impatience. You demand that she tell you everything she knows about their condition and not give you the runaround. With a sigh, she puts her clipboard down and addresses you frankly. “Listen, I may be new to Arkham, but I have seen enough inexplicable maladies in this town to fill entire careers in medicine. I understand why you are concerned. Your friends…” She struggles to find the right words. “They are not simply asleep. It is as if they are hovering somewhere between sleep and unconsciousness, or even death. They are not aware of anything happening around them but appear to be reacting to some kind of internal stimuli.”\nWithout hesitation, you ask if they are dreaming. “Dreaming?” Doctor Maheswaran replies. “It is unlikely, though it might account for their mannerisms. Honestly—and I know this is not exactly reassuring— none of this makes any sense to me, medically speaking.”\nJust then, you see a large, hairy spider crawling on the chest of one of your friends. “Well, that is odd.” Doctor Maheswaran brushes the spider off, and several more emerge from the sheets to take its place. You and the doctor both take several steps back out of pure instinct. You hear heavy footsteps in the hallway outside the emergency ward, and then the lights begin to flicker. “Okay…that is more than simply odd. What in the world is going on out there?” Doctor Maheswaran asks anxiously.\nFor just a moment, you think you hear one of your sleeping companions whisper something. Are they indeed dreaming? And if so, what does their condition have to do with these strange events?"

You dare not tarry or go back the way you came, so you run through the dark, cramped cave with no idea where it might lead. Glancing through the cobwebs to your left and right, you see not just hard rock, but the glimmering of lights, like a sea of stars looming beyond the silken threads. Eventually, you emerge from another wall of webs, only to find yourself in an alleyway in Arkham’s Merchant District, near the Miskatonic River. You have neither the time nor the desire to analyze this, instead deciding to put as much distance as you can between you and the hospital.

Randolph ponders this for a moment, then replies: “Normally, dreamers can return to the real world simply by willing themselves awake, but for some reason, your friends are unable to do so. If you truly wish to help them, you too must enter the Dreamlands and find them. But forcing your way into the Dreamlands is not easy. Such paths are usually accessible only to experienced dreamers, and only in sleep. Still, there are some places where the Dreamlands touch the waking world, and in those places, with the right tools, you may enter the Dreamlands in your physical body. I know of such a place, not far from here. However—”\nBefore Randolph is able to finish his sentence, he is interrupted by a mysterious voice…",

You look to Randolph to make sure he is okay, and it is then that you notice he is not climbing above you as you had suspected he would. You look up to find your companion scowling at you from above, a blade of onyx in his hands. He has cut a segment of the web upon which you are climbing. You plummet to the rocks below, landing painfully on your back. When you look back up at Randolph, his countenance has changed.\n\"Foolish mortals. I was never going to allow you to save your companions. You have an errand of mine to run, and that is your sole purpose. If you wish to live, complete this task for me.\" He peers across at the unfathomble spider that looms before you. \"I shall be the one to claim your world—not that thing.\" Then, Not-Randolph simply turns and walks away."

Days pass as you continue to explore the Underworld, reaching darker and more forbidden lands as you travel deeper and deeper below the crust of the Earth's Dreamlands. Though you eventually find a stairway up, it is very different from the one leading to the Unnamable: a spiraling otherworldy series of steps that reach dizzying heights and break all laws of reality. When you reach the top, your heart sinks. There is no sign of Arkham here. You are greeted instead by a strange, ruined city and its half-human denizens.

How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\nAlejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private. I’ll have to decide tonight; after tomorrow, there won’t be time to change my mind..."

When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet...I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures they encountered...” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for all of us.

But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\nWe ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple. Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?"

While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\nIn the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device.

Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\nJosé was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\nWith the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\nMaria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City.

He’d said he had a job offer for me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect.\nHarlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a distinguished historian from across the southern border. Mr. Vela is a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent many years researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of Aztec city-state called Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the university, and he’s become a pariah among his peers.\nAlejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the rainforests of southern Mexico, where he believes that the ruins of the Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this— or, knowing my old friend, because of this—Harlan is enthralled by Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the expedition (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along.\nThe way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that doesn’t even exist. But if there’s even a slight chance these Eztli people existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer. Preparations are underway, and we should be setting off by the end of the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk."

Perhaps I would rather these events had been a figment of my imagination.\nIn truth, I have no idea how we made it out of the caverns beneath the jungle alive. Simply reaching the abyssal place was a hellish ordeal. My memory of our return trip is muddled and disarrayed. We scrambled in the dark for what seemed like ages. We were out of food, out of supplies, out of hope—but somehow, we found a way out.\nOur reward for preventing calamity was scorn and ridicule. No upstanding paper or university would publish our findings, and of course we possessed no proof of our expedition save for our scars and nightmares. I wish I could say that my memory of these events has faded with each passing day, but I will never forget the alien city we explored in our conical bodies, the serpents that pursued us in red-litten Yoth, the formless abomination that lived in the depths of the Earth...\nPerhaps that is why I fear making a written account of our findings—because these memories will crystallize and become etched in my mind, forever damning me to a life of terror and dismay. Still, the world needs to know what we saw. What we did.",

The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\nIchtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\nCrossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to Mexico City."

She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city, late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\nPadma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive? Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind her as she departs.\nOnce she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation..."

The glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples. Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air.\nRising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\nYour head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But, like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back. I know where to find the Nexus, and you must journey with me.”",

You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion.\n“That woman...She must have realized who I am and followed through the breach I made. Perhaps she wished to know the location of the Nexus, as well,” Ichtaca says cryptically. Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of the past few hours. “You saw it, did you not? The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\nIt is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing...Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time. Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains unspoken: In the haze of broken timelines and unexplainable phenomena, the path you saw was “one future.” A future you intend to fulfill.",

They are horrifying to look upon, but they do not harm you as you expected they might. Your first few days are spent restrained and questioned by the creatures, several of which are somehow able to communicate in English. Others reproduce your language using an odd futuristic machine, played like a musical instrument. You are reminded strangely of the jazz piano at the Nightingale. It is only then that you realize your body has been altered. You have no hands or fingers to play the keys, no legs to walk upon, no lungs to scream out. You are one of them now, one of the creatures that has taken you captive, and your original body is nowhere to be seen.\nDespite your captivity, the creatures do not seem intent on harming you. Instead, they merely interview you, asking all manner of questions about a broad range of topics: your society, your profession, your technology, your ecosystem, your human body. Their thirst for knowledge is unyielding, unending. Their questions range from the mundane to the complex. They implore you to write copiously in your own language, taking anything you write to store away in their vast archives. You are informed that you will be able to roam the city freely if you comply."

Breaking free of your restrains is a hopeless endeavor, but you struggle to escape regardless. Your efforts do not go unnoticed, and one of the creatures is assigned to watch you. It seems more concerned with preventing you from harming your body than preventing you from escaping. After many days of captivity, you find a way to use this to your advantage. You struggle so hard against your restraints that they pierce into your leathery, cold flesh, drawing out a bit of viscous slime-blood. Your guard quickly apporoaches, clicking its claws together repeatedly. It undoes your restraints, and the moment it does, your claw appendages strike at what you believe to be the creature’s throat. It collapses to the floor, writhing in pain."

You are in a hospital, its white halls smelling faintly of disinfectant and other chemicals. Just moments prior, hadn’t you been exploring some kind of underground cavern?... You cannot recall.\n“Excuse me? Come back, you must rest!” The nurse calls out to you, gripping your forearm and pulling you back to your cot. She examines you closely while you recover from the shock of being transported so far in so short a time. “Who is Alejandro?” she asks, and you struggle to recall. The name doesn’t ring a bell.\nYou ask the nurse how you came to be here, wondering why she isn’t surprised at your sudden appearance. “Why, you admitted yourself to St. Mary’s just last night. Do you not remember?” You have no memory of this, and you are starting to grow concerned. “You were acting a little strangely, if I may be so bold. And you spoke in a strange fashion, almost as if English weren’t your first language. But now I see that you probably just drank a little bit too much.” She notices your questioning expression and smiles. “Don’t worry. We get that kind of thing quite often these days, now that all the bars and pubs are on the up-and-up again.”\nYou examine your face in the mirror. You are tired and older than you remember. Something important lies on the very edge of your memory, fuzzy and blurred. It takes about a minute before the significance of the nurse’s last statement catches up to you. Turning back toward the nurse, you ask what year it is, terrified of the answer.\n“Why, 1934 of course. My, you must have had a heck of a night!” She chuckles.",

You are in the deepest level of this subterranean realm now: the caverns Ichtaca referred to as “N’kai.” Nothing could have prepared you for the impervious murk that surrounds you on all sides, an inky darkness that none of your light sources can penetrate. You grope around in the darkness until you feel the jagged wall of the cavern and begin to follow it aimlessly, desperately hoping to find the way forward. A grim realization dawns on you: Even should you complete your task, you will surely never find a way back to the surface. The overwhelming darkness of the cavern fills you with a dread you have never before experienced. You cannot see your hands as you grope about in the darkness, nor can you tell if you are in a narrow tunnel or a vast open space. The ground beside you could extend for miles or abruptly become a bottomless cavern, and you would not be able to tell the difference unless you stepped there. Hours pass as you stumble in the dark, slowly, carefully, nervously. Every step could be your last."

The elaborate stone architecture has been worn away by ages of abandonment, but you sense that there is a history here that runs deeper than you can even fathom. When you turn around to question Ichtaca, you notice a faint yellow glow in her eyes, her pupils narrowed and contracted. “Yoth...the last refuge of Valusia...” she quietly intones.\nJust then, a terrifying roar echoes throughout the cavern. The walls and floor shake with tremendous force, and the red glow that permeates the area brightens. A flood of hisses emerges from the tunnels all around you. Ichtaca walks to the edge of a nearby precipice and looks out over the vast depths. “He is here. I feel his presence. The Father of the Serpents...<b>Yig</b>.”"

Their methods are secret and furtive, and their motives elude you still. However, one piece of vital information has come to light.\n“They seek a place known as the Nexus of N’kai,” Ichtaca claims. A map of Central America lies on the table before you, marked with the previous expedition’s trail. “I have heard of this place, but its exact location is not known to me.” Once again, your mysterious guide appears to know more than she lets on.\nWith no other leads to follow, you are left with no choice. Once more you must journey into uncharted territory in search of answers...but will anyone return this time?",

I seek only to preserve my own record of these events, for I do not wish the passage of time to erase them completely. After all, these are not my memories, but the memories of my other self: the self who ventured through time and space to save humanity.\nIt is difficult to explain how we did what we did. After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember. Somehow, I remember everything.",

We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.\nThe dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.\nAlready one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds."
